It sucks. After the update that was supposed to prevent it from constantly crashing... It crashes without even getting passed the opening page.... Get it together","I have used this app for many years and love using it.  It is generally very easy to use and understand.  However with recent update, have experienced numerous crashes especially in map mode!!","So many updates and it still kicks you out or won't load at all. Too bad- I use this frequently.","I also experienced crashing every two minutes with the second last update. And now, with the most recent update, it doesn't crash any more, it just hangs endlessly on the opening screen. Smooth work, Realtor.ca.","The new update has made the app awful to use compared to how it was before. The user interface is really buggy and all of the aesthetics are bad too. The app was great before but they found a way to make it awful.","It used to be a useless and full of bug, but this new update made it a complete garbage!","Latest update is terrible. I don\u2019t even want to use it. Why doesn\u2019t it group properties based on area?  The map is so busy with little numbers all over the place. Absolute garbage!!","Big complaint since last update is that the horizontal view of the pictures makes them shrink. Never used to do that.","The previous update sucked. \nThis latest one is even worse. \nI just use my home PC now or Web browser. \nCrashes tonnes. \n\nPlease hire some pros for app development.","Why the latest version is so dark? This 4.*  update basically tried to make us delete the app and to use others. Using Satellite? you shall be fired.  Can you put the 3.* version back?  If you can not make it better, don\u2019t update!","Need update to iPhone x","The all is absolutely horrible especially since the last change","It keeps crashing, zooming in when I don't want it to, gets stuck on a certain location and will not move. Do not update to this version!","Since the latest update when you zoom in on an area the mass redraws and moves slightly as if it is trying to centre the map.","No longer have the ability to log in to see favorited across my devices. App design is worse with less functions definitely a horrible update","The recent updates to this app have all but rendered it useless. I am missing deals that I used to speak to my realtor about. Lost business for both parties.","This app use to be so user friendly. The update has made it terrible and completely unusable. Whoever approved this app update should be fired.","I am not able to use the app after the last update. It crashes immediate after the launch. I had to uninstall it for now.","If you are not ready, you shouldn\u2019t have pushed this update.","Latest update somehow managed to build on the horrible experience and make it even worse. Buggy, slow, pictures lag and freeze, and you have to swipe back to the left to start at the beginning? Fire this developer!!!","This update is horrible - hard to navigate, glitches ... I'm so sorry I updated.","Loved this App before but your recent update is a complete botch and your user interface has gone out the window. Not sure who convinced you this was a good idea.","Do NOT update your app, or install this version. You WILL regret it!\nIts simply unusable, who designs this garbage?","As of Sept. 28, 2017 this app does not work. I installed the latest update when it came out and it worked for a couple weeks and then the same issue I submitted below is still occurring. The app is useless on my iPhone 6, iOS 11.0.1.\n\nMay 31, 2017. The app has been crash by consistently for months now on iPhone 6. The map won't load. Getting repeated error messages. Useless at this point.","ever since you guys did the update the app won't even load past the splash page.  That loading wheel just spins and spins until the app ever tidally crashes.  Realtors pay you guys way to much to have the app do this.  Fix it","Ever since I did the recent update for this app when I open it to try and load it I just get the wheel of death on the main screen. Nothing happens.","Update after update, this app has got worse and worse. Pre-update: continuously crashing and impossible map navigation to post-update: the app will not even open. Lost all my favourite houses and search criteria. Very unfortunate, hope to see improvement very soon.","Do not like the new update. When you filter in listings from today date only, all listing still come up. Not as user friendly as the old app.","New update is useless and very difficult and counterintuitive to navigate. Looking for other options","I was happy to see the notification for the update (fixed bugs like crashing with more updates to come). Now it won't even go beyond the homepage before crashing. Time to hire some new developers.","This update was a major regression. Lost all my favourites and the menus are not phone friendly.","Your new update makes the site harder to navigate and the house description light grey colour is very difficult to read.   I won\u2019t be using this app much anymore as I look for a new house.  Very disappointed.   I\u2019m surprised you wouldn\u2019t have tested out the font colours before your release.","Did you even test this update before releasing it ?","Terrible, buggy update. Wants location services turned on or will give you repeated error messages. Pathetic and frustrating.\nUpdate regarding new version released on May 14: app won't even start! Thanks","New \u201cupdate\u201d is horrendous. Eliminated many important features and having a swipe to see listings is awful. NOT using this anymore as it\u2019s useless now.","The app is unusable since the last update. Worked adequately beforehand.","The previous version was fine-- it searched properties, and did what it was meant to do.  Now with the last update, it's nothing but crashes.  If you have the app already, don't update it.  Wait until the next update.","Latest update makes the app completely useless and extremely difficult to use.","After a version update the app is finally rock solid.. Very helpful!","Ever since the current update this app is useless. If you can avoid the update do so.","Why even release the update like that","App is always crashing. Seems like the more updates they make, the worse it gets","This app once was great. After the last update, it is junk. App constantly crashes, not a friendly user interface as it was in previous version. I once used this app almost daily, now its more frustration then anything. I always thought updates are supposed to be a improvement. Lol.","Used to be an OK app, but the recent update makes it crash before I even have a chance to browse.","The new update is very slow to use. Not sure why change something that wasn\u2019t broken!\nLove it before, not so sure if I can go on using it any longer","App crashes, technical support told me to update to newest version which doesn't even load .","The new update killed the app. The big change was removing the ability to filter - price, bedroom etc. Now the app is useless.","This app crashes all the time, and takes forever to load. Annoying and unnecessary pop-ups. Cannot view the walk score on the search results screen (you used to be able to) and they removed a lot of good features and added a lot of useless ones. Also, there appears to be some kind of interference that this app pops up for no reason when I log onto my CandyCrush game app using Facebook.. I'm not sure what the developer of this newest update did, but I wish there was a way for me to roll back to an older edition / update of this app as this version is NOT user-friendly at all, it's just a big nightmare!","Really pleased with the ability to share listings via text/messenger/etc.... it was my only major complaint about the app before the big update.\n\nOverall though, it\u2019s become much more difficult to use since the update. Specifically, I really don\u2019t like the dark map background and miss neighbourhood detail previously available on the old version. It\u2019s not very difficult to see the positioning of the buildings, free space, etc...","Whoever was in charge of this update should be fired.\nIt doesn't freeze as much now - but you cant zoom in accurately and it's very slow to load.","I can't believe anyone could make this app any worse, but with the latest version, they've done it. If there was a -5 option for stars, this app would get it. So many horrible new \"faults\" with the new app I'm not going to even start. So disappointed.","You took an app that worked well to change it to this junk update you can\u2019t even filter out freehold houses and this app is almost useless","New update is removed all useful features. Now, the application is nothing without account support. There is no syncing between your devices. It\u2019s not understandable what idea was behind this outdated update!!!!!???","Finds the listings I'm looking for after crashing a bunch. Since the update this app has become quite poor. I used to enjoy finding listings by map, which now can't be done. Even once the area your looking for has been found you are not able to zero in on any specific.","Sorry, but I had to install the new update and I do not like it at all. The layout is hard to navigate and I don\u2019t like the map and it lags a lot when trying to load properties. \nI want the search options to be at the bottom of the screen like before the update I don\u2019t want to go to a new menu to select the rooms/prices etc. \nI purposely didn\u2019t instal the update on my old phone so I don\u2019t have to deal with the new version.","New update makes app unusable","Horrible update. Can't get past the main screen before it constantly crashes. Worst update!!","It used to be a good app, i was able to rent a place using the App. They changed and update it, and it is a useless, nonsense App ever found .","Every update is the same buggy garbage. I got house sigma, you can see the wolf days right in the same app too.","Was this update suppose to fix the app or break it even further? App loads and then crashes immediately. I'm at loss for words here guys.","For the love of God stop messing with this app! Each update makes its functionality worse.","Please update the photo on your landing page","After the new update / format change, app is not user friendly.","This one star review makes me sad because the app used to be amazing! I would have given five stars for the previous version. Some improvements have been made in the last few updates, but the constant crashing is insanely annoying -- especially when it happens after choosing all of my search specifics! Garhhhh so annoying!","Since the updated version I can no longer search homes. Look up one and it crashes. Even after reinstalling several times. Don't put out an update until you know for sure it's ready. So frustrating when trying to buy a house.","Search used to be bad, now the app doesn't even load without crashing.  Updates keep making it worsel","I love this app but have major crashing issues. It has been crashing for the last 2 plus years. But with the last update it never made it past the loading screen. It's really frustrating. I deleted the app cause I had enough.","Finding my around your update on this app is more difficult then it needs to be.\ud83d\udc4e","Is this a joke? The app gets worse and worse culminating on the latest version that crashes when opening","App will open after the latest update but crashes almost immediately. It worked just fine before the latest set of updates, so disappointing.","What kind of idiots work on this app now the new update still crashes but at least it crashed on the home scree saves you the trouble of actually trying to use it","Loved the app before the update. Now it's not even worth having in my phone.","This app, just like the Realtor.ca website, is always so buggy and counter-intuitive, even after their so-called 'update'! They need to take a good look at their UX.","This app is so bad that I had to turn off auto updates so garbage like this won't update to my phone.\n\nApp used to be usable, now it makes me want to harm things. I'm so frustrated I just never want to move rather than deal with this app to try and look at properties.","Please update app so full screen can be used on new phones","I hate this update. I used this everyday before update now it just does not seem worth it. I won't refer my clients to view property on this anymore","Clearly this is another group of people that have realtors spending money on developers that aren't testing what they're doing before they're putting it out there... Because you know, realtors make it \"safer\", except when they're not.\n\nFirst update had a horrible memory leak that would eat up my phone (iPhone 6 Plus) and require me to kill the app and reboot to fix.\n\nThis one randomly crashes after deleting and reinstalling last time. Just garbage.\n\nHow about you buy a phone and test it for updates on a phone? \ud83d\udc4d","How come when I click on homes in Whitby I get listings in Ajax and Oshawa also. I really do hate this new update.","This app was great until the most recent update. This app now sucks so bad that I won't use it. It would be quicker to request the local paper and look up the houses for sale that way.    The developers need to erase this update from their memory and go back to the old app.  Why do they need to screw with things that work","The latest great update has absolutely ruined the app/experience. I don\u2019t even like using it anymore. It used to be so intuitive and now I don\u2019t even know where to start and everything is buried within hidden menus.","Today's update (May 24/16) was supposed to cure the crashing. It crashes far worse, even after deleting and re-installing. They even tried to justify and blame-shift on to Apple by saying if it crashes you might have to re-install like happens with many apps, and that Apple is trying to resolve. Baloney - I've never had a problem with dozens and dozens of apps like I have with this piece of garbage. I see that most of the hundreds of terrible reviews from the update of a couple of weeks ago have been removed. Well, they're going to get even worse reviews this time around. Do not update! It crashes constantly. If you turn off GPS, it keeps reminding it can't locate your location - when I don't want properties in my area but far away. When I entered an area in rural Ontario, it took me to the Winnipeg area. Mickey Mouse piece of amateur programming. Should not be allowed on the App Store.","I have never used an app that crashes more frequently than realtor.ca seriously, it has never improved no matter how many updates you do","The new update is terrible. It's difficult to figure out, the new map is awful and you can only move it up and down, you can't adjust the direction you're looking anymore. They messed with a good app. I hate it now and I'll be looking for a new app until realtor.ca fixes this one.","Just wanted to agree with the rest of the most recent reviews and say - the update sucks. Not user friendly at all , I used to use the app like every day and stopped because it\u2019s frustrating.","App once again will not open after recent update. Just sits on loading screen.","Junk app shuts down with every search update","Hate the update \u2026 just cuz it\u2019s different doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s better.","Another brutal update!! Worse than the last and didn't think that was possible. Tried deleting and reinstalling but that didn't help at all. Open the app and seconds later it closes...over and over again. Awful, just awful! Can they not fix this properly??!! So frustrating!!","iPhone X has been out for a year.  Update the app for iPhone X screen size.","I live in Saskatoon and love this app!  Not glitchy and the update earlier this week improved it even more. You won't be disappointed - not a waste of your time AT ALL.","Update - May 2016 - Just got an automatic update for this app and now it won't even stay open. It keeps crashing! I need to find some other means of looking for real estate. \n\nAs said many times in these reviews, the new update makes this app completely useless. I hate having to jump through hoops, not just once but several times, to get where I want to go.","You used to be able to access commercial properties quite easily, now with the recent update not at all. Whomever approved this update and released it dropped the ball...","Too many problem with the new update you need to redesign the app before you loose users.","I have become accustomed to the new changes and updates. I get how the new version works now. Thanks for this reliable app!","The new update does not have the option to sign into my Realtor account. So, my favourites are connected from my mobile app to my computer. This was a step backwards and I would suggest this be sorted for the next update.","Search the reviews by \u201cmost recent\u201d. The collective opinion of all users for the past 5 months is that this app is trash and the update sucks. How many bad reviews do you need to collect before you decide to fix it? Ridiculous.","Getting worse with each update. Started lagging quite a bit. Won't open at all with latest update. \n\nUpdates really need to be tested before releasing to the public!\n\nUPDATE - June 2 2016 - even with latest update, it's still crashing constantly.","This app is terrible even with the latest update. What are you guys doing??? It\u2019s Unusable, very glitchy, and the worst of all ...it boots you out when looking at listings and have to start all over again. Grrr!!!","UPDATE THE APP FOR IPHONE X, its been 2 years already!","Hate the way the update makes the map black and harder to maneuver. Loved the old way the app was set up, easy access to click \u201cnew listing\u201d and then sort by the day the listing was put up. The absolute BEST part of the new update is being able to text the listing and not email. Amazing new feature \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","I can't load the app after latest update may 2016","New update makes the app unusable, the last version was great and easy to use. This version is horrible and its recent updates on it are a joke","New update and same issues. You put out and update and then the app crashes? How does this happen? Fire your developers!","Can not even start the app since the last update !!!!!","Where to start?!? Images are not properly sized. Keeps reverting back to list view wherever I move location on map, oh and it keeps crashing. I'm sure there are many more problems, but I gave up using the app.\nAnd get rid of that stupid FORESEE feedback dialog. That's what the App Store comments are for!!!  \n\nThe latest update was supposed to fixes the crashing, now I can't even get past the splash screen before it crashes.\n\nUPDATE v3.0.2 - they said they fixed some bugs.... How about fixing the crashing that renders this app useless (and yes, I did delete the app and reinstall).","I enjoy the app very much. However, since the last update the app just indicates that it's loading and never opens. Hopefully there's a new update to correct this soon. As the app is useless currently.","Each update never solves the problem. Crashes consistently","Used to be so much better \nI hate the latest update\nWhy did you change it?\nReally disappointed\nI loved this app \nNot anymore","I loved this app, until the last update. It is no longer user friendly.","I have been using the app until the most recent update but not anymore.","The latest update is awful to work with. The map looks terrible and doesn\u2019t even have roads labeled. But what worse is the listings aren\u2019t organized in any logical order. \nIt\u2019s an awful update. Please change it back!","Did the update that was suppose to fix things.... Only made it worse!!!","What a joke! This update just causes it to stay on the home screen and than crashes! How the hell did you think this was better?!?!?","Will no longer even load since last update.  Hangs for a bit then crashes.","Used to be quite a useful app. Since the update, the app just repeatedly crashes. It also prevents users from panning on the map to check listings in different areas. A thorough overhaul is needed. Aren't these versions tested before release?","The update is horrible. It used to be so easy to use. Why make the app so unnecessarily complicated???","The app was crashing before the latest update, and now it doesn't even load...","The app does nothing but crash all the time. It is in need of some serious updates and bug fixes. I would wait until a new version comes out before downloading and using this app.","WTF! Have you ever tested before released the update?","Four days later and still no update to fix the last update... Terrible!","Has not opened since last update. Useless!!!","The latest update (april 2021) absolutely ruined the app.\nPlease undo the update asap!","The app used to crash all the time so I was so happy to see an update. Little did I know the update would make the app unusable. The app won't open since the last update.","The last update made it very difficult to use, but after this update it won't load at all.","Was the update even tested before rolling it out.  \n\nIt\u2019s not usable.","Latest update has rendered the app unusable. Crashes on start-up on my 5S.","After the last update, it doesn't even load past the welcome splash screen (which in and of itself is useless and would have been an annoying delay before using the actual app) but now is just a permanent screen saver since it fails to load.\n\nThis is by far the worst app I have ever downloaded.\n\nComplete disappointment.","Remember when Coke changed their formula and it was an utter fail?  Welcome to the new update.","Horrible after last update","The new update is awful. Minimal functions, impractical, not user friendly at all. Used to be good, now you\u2019ve ruined it.","What happened? It was fine before the updates!","App is crashing when you open it (only after the most recent update).\n- the last update before this recent one: the map is touchy and jumps to spots where you didn't intend to go to; when you would click on a circle to open up the listings, the listings would appear for a split second and then drop back down off the screen \n- I used to be able to turn home photos horizontally on my iPhone to enlarge the photos but that doesn't work anymore","I don't know how you can update a product and make it worse. This one has a mind of its own...I don't understand.","Do not update or download this app it doesn't work,open or hell you find a house...very poorly created and improved...doesn't work since update on May 14 2016","Don't know what's happening things get worse with each update.","This new update sucks. My saved preferences, viewing history and favourites are gone!  Zolo is my new real estate app of choice. Too bad to as I found my last house on Realtor.ca","With each update this app seems to get worst. It closes unexpectedly or sometimes won't open at all. It gets worse each update on many key things. Currently the app is not user friendly, very complicated to use, difficult to search by location or address. It's so bad that I'm no longer looking at houses!!! Get your crap together and set it up the way it was 1-2 years ago. Easy to use and very organized.","Latest update causes app to not even open. Stays stalled at splash screen with indefinitely spinning wheel.  Then...crashes.","In all ways worse than the previous version. Even crashes during basic functions like filtering by list date. I almost never leave reviews but this forced update is very disappointing.","Update***** do not update for a second time, they still have not figured out to make this app function at all***  geez I can't believe how brutal it is \n\n*****This the worst update ! The update does not function at all ! NO DO NOT UPDATE !!!!****","I don't understand how this can be such a horrible app after the update. Even more, I can't wrap my head around the fact that it is getting worse and not being fixed. You need new technicians that know what they're doing.","New update sucks, look at something and the app crashes waste of time!","After new update to fix all the issues, some how they found a way to make it worse, I feel embarrassed for you, it's now become a joke in the office","I use this app daily and since the recent update I dread trying to use it. I'm not afraid of change, but this version is not user friendly, has many bugs and crashes within minutes. \nI really hope they can fix these issues. Or just rerelease the old version. It had zero problems and was so easy to use.","I was a daily user of the previous app for years. The new update removed so much stuff the app is pretty much useless now.","Crashed all the time before the last update. Now it won't even open since the last update. Contacted support, got no resolution. Deleted the app. Was really convenient when it worked since I was looking for a house, but totally useless now.","Why did u have to update something that had nothing wrong with it. This new update is just terrible and just made the app more complicated .","Are the Devs not testing their work?  \n\nNew update stinks, pictures load like crap, they shrink when you flip horizontal, and kept crashing.  \n\n Now to top it off, the most recent update fixed the crashing problem, it won't even allow me to get into the app.\n\nWhy fix what wasn't broken before.","Absolute best app for Realestate. Glitches have been sorted out with the new update","This app was barely useable before the update. Now it is impossible to use.","The newest update isn\u2019t very user friendly definitely a case of don\u2019t fix what\u2019s not broken I\u2019m not using it anymore and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one","*Update: 1 year later. The map moves automatically (you'll see what I mean) and makes it very frustrating and difficult to use. Until it's fixed, this app sucks. \n\nOriginal review: Very user friendly once you get familiar with it.","With the latest update when you try to drag the map, and then try to zoom in on a specific area the whole app crashes. When you open it again it\u2019s back to the home page","Barely better than the 3.0 update. How does an organization the size of this release such a crappy version of software.","Used to be OK - latest update has completely crashed it. Horribly frustrating. Waste of time...","Since update the app always crashes and has less features such as bedroom and bathroom selection. \n\nDon't understand how you downgrade an app but it functions worse","Worse update. It's crashing all the time. Can it get worse!!","I regret downloading the update. I should\u2019ve read the reviews. How can you update an app and make it so terrible? Change it back.","This app is terrible. The map sucks, the app closes by itself all the time... If it opens at all. It used to work, but after some recent updates it SUCKS. I deleted it and re-downloaded it, nothing helps.","My home searching is no more fun since the update. This used to be an only app I used out of all the apps out there because it used to be simple, wonderful and user friendly. Now it looks like any other apps. You say you listen to users\u2019 concern, but another update and no fix done that reflects ppl\u2019s actual concern. Your rating went down, and so much negative review since last update; yet have no interest in making any improvement. Such a shame... tsk tsk I am deleting this app after writing this review. Bye!","The latest update has made the app completely unusable. Don't waste your time downloading.","It used to be great. Now-with the new update, it\u2019s awful. Layout is weird and NOT user friendly and the map is ridiculous...","Latest update has made the app useless. It no longer lets you log in so lost all my favourites. The search map is hard to navigate now too. This update sucks and I will be removing the app and deleting my account if it doesn\u2019t get fixed soon.","The last update has effectively ruined the entire app, sure it\u2019s slicker, but you can\u2019t scroll down quickly through the properties anymore, only thing left is the is clunky sideways scrolling..","5 star to the last version \n1 star after the update. \nThis app is completely useless now!","The old app was much easier on the eyes and I mean it's actually hard to look at. This was a very disappointing update, it is not at all user friendly anymore.","Look at the feedback - it\u2019s pretty clear. The update has made the app literally unusable. Why has it not been changed back yet? Pathetic.","App doesn't open anymore. Just immediate crash. Updates were a terrible idea in this case! Would give zero stars if I could.","Before the two most recent updates, this app worked ok. First update blew up when using map. Second update won't even open. Perhaps it's time for some quality control. In the meantime, how about reverting to last working version until you get problems solved?","This app update has made it almost unusable on an iPhone....zooming in and out, stretched pictures....buggy with saved searches....I have only left one other review before since using apps on my iPhone over the last several years but felt I had to leave one here....this app is downright horrible \n\nVersion: 3.0.1\nDevice: iPhone\nOS: iPhone OS 9.3.1","New update made it so it no longer opens. What a waste. Wish I could give a negative star review","Iv enjoyed a simple and reliable realtor.ca app until this update. It was made cumbersome, too many slow effects like and screen clutter, but worst - its totally unstable. Selecting listed from date causes app to crash. And instead of just using \u201c last 7 days\u201d or \u201c last month\u201d options like it did before and like centris does, app  is asking user to set specific date which does not move. So if you want \u201clast 7 days\u201d you need to update the \u201cfrom..\u201d date every time. Now map - dark blue like night view, hard to navigate, why???  I give 2 stars out of respect for previous version,  new one barely deserves 1 star.","I can\u2019t find the rentals in the new app. Why removing the function? It\u2019s so difficult to use after the update and I like the previous version more that shows all the details.","Guys, it's 2016, get your act together! I didn't think app could possibly get worse... With new update app doesn't even open anymore; just crashes on its opening screen.","This new update does not allow me to scroll through the listings, it gets stuck on the 8th listing and will not scroll any further.  I have the latest update on iPhone 7, running the latest update of Realtor...  this seems to happen often, and I find that the bugs are not fixed promptly.  Of course I will continue to use this app and wait for the fix - it is just really frustrating to wait.","The new update removed your ability to sync to your previous profile meaning you can no longer access any saved searches or favourites. The new map layout is more difficult to access as well. The app glitches often and is difficult to view houses located on the map. The update to photograph layout makes it more difficult to see how many images there are. Just not a fan after this update, I\u2019m considering switching to zillow","The last update broke the app. \n\nUI UX haven\u2019t been thought threw....looks like it was updated by someone that never used the app","I gotta say this app is one of the most non-user-friendly apps I have ever used. It needs a complete overall, including the website. Here's a tip - next time you update it, how about having some people test it before you release the update. Absolutely terrible! Too many problems to list. Gives me a headache!","Very glitchy , searching via map is a disaster.  Amazing the app gets worse after each update","App is useless now, update it please.","Since the last update the app crashes every time I try to open the app. I can't even make a search because I haven't seen the search page that's how bad the crashing has become since the last update. Please fix.","The last update is horrendous. Was this tested on users? There\u2019s no way a designer did this without research, especially without considering user behaviour and adaptability. Time to delete the app","Shitty update, crashes and kicks out of the App all the time. Don't update!!!!!","The latest interface change after update really sucks and needs to be reverted.","Not sure who approves this update, but I will be deleting the app. \n\nI will use the house sigma app from now on.","The latest update is glitchy.  The app randomly shuts down.  There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to save a few searches anymore.  When I select detached homes, nothing shows up.  Photos don\u2019t loop back to the beginning.  There doesn\u2019t seem to have been any useful updates.","Why did you change from the last version?  I used this app late last year, and it was a pleasure to navigate back then.  I don't know who they got to redesign the app, but it is TERRIBLE.  Ever since the update came out a couple months back, it's been broken.  I stopped using it for a while, I was waiting for you guys to work the bugs out, but nothing has been corrected at all!  The map view is essentially useless, with that frustrating auto zoom every time you touch it.  I am done trying to be patient.  I will not use this app again, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone I know.  My advice to the company management at realtor.ca...terminate the fool or fools who decided to update your app which had nothing wrong with it, and was easy and fun to use.  That move was horrendous.  Shaking my head in disbelief....","iOS users don\u2019t update!!!  Can\u2019t read it not functional. Wife did her iPhone glad I didn\u2019t do mine","The latest update has made the app unusable. The default map option is waaay too broad of an area and zooming in results in consistent crashes. I\u2019m using the HouseSigma app instead now, it\u2019s way more useful and user-friendly.","Love the new look. Hate that I can't use the app. I'm trying to buy a house and my entire save history/property tour picks were all deleted. And to top it off the all just crashes constantly. Don't release an update thats not ready! Please !","Didn't think it could get any worse but the latest version sets a new low. Horrible app, impossible to use and crashes all the time. Zero stars.","Had to delete the app after the last update. Couldn't open it anymore, app was freezing at start. Need a urgent fix","Used to be ok. Since last update it is unusable!!!!","This new update has made basically every part of the user experience so much more convoluted and difficult to use. I\u2019ll be forced to use another app now.","The new update makes the app so hard to browse comparing to the previous version. Crash all the time.","So disappointed in this update!! Map is illegible and basically useless so now it\u2019s impossible to find what I\u2019m looking for easily... won\u2019t be using this app anymore...","The new update has made the app so confusing and difficult to use. It was user friendly before now its just annoying.","DO NOT UPDATE TO LATEST VERSION!! If you're lucky enough to have an older version of this installed, keep it. The new one is unusable. Stupid, as it worked great before and didn't need any changes. How something this non-functional can be released is beyond belief.","Previous version always crashed. Newest update won't even load. App developer needs to get into another line of work. I suggest real estate.","The update made it worse than before. Did an entry level programming student make this app? Wow is it bad","New update is very confusing not like the old easy to use ap","I originally used this app several times every day but the new update has changed that. I dislike the app now since user interface is awful and you can no longer save multiple searches. Hope they change this as soon as possible.","App worked well until the new update. Little bit more attractive layout. More difficult to navigate, however. Most annoying is that it crashes all the time. Saved searches don't remember cities. But now I can't even use the app because it will crash even before loading. I use to be able to view a couple houses first. Terrible update","Outsource your development cause you're completely missing the mark here. Update makes this completely unusable.","The new update is TERRIBLE!  It\u2019s no longer easy to use. It\u2019s confusing and feels crammed on the screen and I have a big screen.  Would give 0 stars if possible","This update has horrible functionality changes and is very buggy. Your product managers, ux people, and client side developers should be fired. Roll back the update. Super fail.","Worse then before the update","This used to be my favourite app to check. The upgrade is awful I can't even get in past the first loading screen! Not happy about this update at all! Please work on bringing it back to its original state!","This update sucks. The app won't load past the first screen. Waste of time","worked pretty well before this update, now it's slow, full of bugs, and crashes all the time. in other words, it's useless.","This app is great for searching homes, until it suddenly crashes then nothing loads. Ever. Updates need to be more consistent and up to date with technology. I've even deleted and re-added the app numerous times.","This app prior to the recent two updates with the newer look was already sub-standard but somewhat functional. After the recent update they went backwards and took away some of the functionality and made it worse. Soon after, there was another update to supposedly patch the problems but now the app doesn't even open at all. Great work developers! I guess testing the coding of the app is not a requirement anymore.","I was initially excited to see an update for this app. The previous update, while making the app look more attractive, crashed every single time I used it! Sometimes I couldn't even view ONE house without the app crashing. VERY frustrating. \nThis newest update is even worse than the last! The app fails to even open now. Horrible. \nPlease fix these problems!!!","Garbage even after the latest update.","Ever since the update I keep getting kicked off the app. And then it sets me to the other side of the country and when I get back to my area and zoom, the app closes and I have to go through it all again. Over and over","I have loved and used this app for a few years. The new recent update is horrible for finding anything. It does not list homes in any kind of order. It doesn\u2019t give you an option to choose how to filter what you are looking for. It\u2019s as though the app took a giant leap backwards","This update sucks","Failed update. The latest update completely messed up the app. Swiping through pictures doesn't work. Back button goes to the main search page instead of the latest page. The older version was way better than this","The new update is a significant downgrade to the app. The new UI is slower, buggier, and makes it more difficult to view specific properties. An unfortunate step back.","The latest updates have really improved the overall app experience. It\u2019s much easier to navigate and share listings compared to before. Well done!","I've been using the app for a few years now.. It is always glitchy. The search feature is horrible and since the recent update the app will quit before you can view anything past its loading page. Incredibly annoying and doesn't add any confidence in the Real Estate consumer-professional relationship.","Made me update to the new app, goes into full screen now, won't let me login to see my favorites, ugh","New update ruined the app.","Still crashes even after the new update today. horrible app. Wish it worked like it did in the past.","New update:\nWorks quite nicely now.  The only thing to bear in mind is that the filters don\u2019t work if you have your phone screen on dark mode, as the text is not visible.\n\nUpdate:  this Seems a lot better- much smoother.  I can actually find a property now without it jerking me away to somewhere else as soon as I tap on it.  Great app now- it's my go-to place as I shop around for a place to live. \n\n----old review:\nDoubt anyone reads reviews before updating.. But just don't.\n\nHaven't had the crashing issues others have, but the map navigation is utterly hopeless.  Keeps jerking me around to places I don't want to go, gets the pinpoints all messed up- tapping the same location twice gives different results.  Basically not navigable.  I'm deleting this until it get a couple updates.","So many bugs since the last update! Can\u2019t use any of the filters.","Locks at load screen and silently crashes on my 6s.\n\nUpdate: crashed immediately in new version","As many have stated, the interaction with the app is clunky and horrible. Not sure how it got this bad as the previous version did not have these issues. The latest update did nothing to address or fix these issues. Try again. 1 star.","Does this app even get updates anymore? It\u2019s not intuitive, it\u2019s buggy and I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s been abandoned.","*edited again: oh wow realtor.ca you just keep outdoing yourself!  The app worked for TWO days after I uninstalled and reinstalled it, I just got another update and lo and behold it doesn't even open before crashing...again!  I am getting pretty sure this is a social experiment in people's tolerance for terrible ineffective apps. \n*edited to add: since the most recent update to fix the breaks it's even WORSE - it doesn't even get past the main screen before crashing. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU REALTOR.CA IT WAS PERFECT BEFORE, WHY DID YOU HAVE TO RUIN A GOOD THING?!!!\n\nOriginal review: I don't know what they were trying to do with this update. It wiped all my saved searches and the app crashes every time I try to use it. It screws up looking for new listings and applying search criteria and the email feature used to save the last address but now has to be entered fresh every time. Don't update!  This is the worst!","very bad update, not mobile phone friendly at all. Please change","No where on the app to login? What kind of update is this?","do not like the new update.. very glitchy and not as appealing to look at.","The new update sucks, can't scroll pictures correctly , hopefully this will get fix when you swipe it stay in the middle of two pictures. :/","Latest update makes this application useless.","The recent update removed user interaction. You can no longer make a profile and save fav properties to your listing!","New update is terrible. The search constantly says no matches found (which is clearly an error) and the new map is hard to use. My wife and I have used this app regularly for years, but this is the worst one. Hope they change it back soon.","I don't often write these reviews, but the user experience of this latest app update is TERRIBLE. I used to browse realtor.ca frequently but I just can't use it anymore.","Please change your user inference back to what you were using prior to this new update. The new update is tricky, and complicated to use.","App is broken since \"upgrade\". Cant even use it anymore. Every time I launch the app it tells me I'm not connected to the internet regardless if I'm on wifi or data. Preferred the app before this update.","Update October 5, 2021\nThank you for the new update! Love the new layout and search!\n5 Stars!\n\nLike the app but ever since the latest update (late Nov 2020) it shows all Land under Residential only searches (it never done that before this update). Please update this bug only to show housing under this residential search.","I\u2019ve emailed the support and have received not reply.. \nlatest update still crashes on startup. Diss a faking pointing!\n\nSince previous update the app is unusable for me. Crashes on start every time!\nThe App Store says it\u2019s compatible with iOS 12 and higher but I think that\u2019s incorrect. \nIt\u2019s be great to have the app back. I used this app daily for years. \n\n\ud83d\ude15","This app doesn't even load properly anymore. Very disappointed with the 'updates'.","How does this app keep getting worse with every update? It was perfectly fine before the latest update","The latest app update made the app so terrible. I hate the layout and when you click on a number is zooms in on the area. So stupid. Change it back","So frustrating. Crashing every few seconds. Unusable. Updates seem to make it worse. Seriously, get it together.","This used to be my go-to realtor app until recent update. Now it crashes within seconds of opening it - EVERY time. I have never seen anything like it. They need to update and fix this ASAP before everyone turns to ZOLO.","the latest update is not a intuitive as the last version. I found myself fumbling through house searches and getting frustrated as I try to move the map. this latest update doesn't offer a great user experience.","This app is going in the wrong direction. From bad to worse. The new map search is un-usable and very frustrating. Are your people aware that we the user are using this on a small phone screen? The last update was extremely frustrating as it made it worse and now you put out this version and I am dumbfounded. Why do app developers keep fixing things that aren\u2019t broken and making them worse? I just want to sip my morning coffee and search properties on my phone this should not be a tough concept. Yet another glitchy crap app that use to be glorious. Sad.","Definitely do not like the look and feel of this after the update. Original version much more user friendly.","This is an awful update. Not sure how it made it to a production release.","Was working fine.  Now crashes immediately.  No comms from support.\n\nUpdate: \nHave received response from crea support 3.12.21 stating the app no longer supports iOS 12 (iPhone 6).  But the App Store still says it does.. Seems to me if you\u2019re making a change like this you update the source description with the update.  Now I\u2019m wondering if I just got blown off. \n\n\u201cThank you for you email.

Hard to navigate","Likely would have rated 4 star before this issue but because I can\u2019t see drop down options (iPad) it makes using the app difficult to the point of useless. Hopefully an update will fix this issue","After update crap \ud83d\udca9","This update is awful what the hell were you guys thinking","Haven't been able to use the app since the last update.","Latest update is terrible!! Who approved this? \n\nYou cannot easily search for newest listings, have to pick a date.\n\nCannot select the MLS number to copy and paste!! Who checked that and said this was a good idea?\n\nLast update was as great. This is two steps backwards. Terribly disappointing","They say 3rd times the charm! Well not with this app. How can these people who develop this app call themselves developers? It's really pathetic that 3 updates later, your app is still garbage and not usable. Stop pushing through these useless updates and take the time to ACTUALLY test your app before launching. The last 3 \"updates\" you had, the app is either completely useless or is usable for max a minute. But if you bothered to do the slightest QA, you might have caught that.","Your new update for 2021 is horrible.  Why did you change it?  It is extremely hard to navigate and  the pictures bounce around.when trying to find anything.  Wjat a waste.","Absolute crap.  Latest update won\u2019t run at all.  Vesion 4.7.0 - runs the splash screen, then crashes.  Garbage.","Latest update made the app much worse; the maps section auto zooms when you click on a listing number, click number again and zooms again, very irritating.","iPhone X update does not show filter options. Everything is blank!","This app is awful, especially since the last 2 updates. It now crashes immediately after opening","Not much more I can say as I can't access any of the features of the app. The most recent 'updates' seem to be getting worse with each release.","Ever since the most recent update this app has been constantly crashing.  I can't search anything!","Since the latest update I haven\u2019t been able to put n a search price using iPhone 11. Sorta makes the App useless as I get too much stuff out of my price range when searching. \nFix this bug and the app moves up a couple stars. I\u2019ve tried powering off/on my phone and reinstalling the app. Nothing works.","This app used to be somewhat functional - sure it wasn't perfect but it at least worked. Ever since the update with the newer look and feel this app is essentially useless. The last few updates just crash, even after reinstalling the app several times. The searches don't work properly, the interface is terrible.\nI used to like this app and used it more frequently that my computer but now I am so frustrated I'm not even going to bother. If I could give this app less than one star, I would.  It's called testing - maybe the developers should try it before releasing an app so that its at least somewhat functional.","Ummmmm seriously wth ? We\u2019re trying to move, had a bunch of favorited saved and this latest update just wiped them all ? Seriously ??? Not cool at all","The new update is so stupid \nI didn\u2019t like the map","What happened to the functional app? This is garbage and useless... Why wound you make a worse app with the update... Go back to the original please.","After the latest update it crashes within seconds after opening the app. Not impressed since I'm in the market for a new house.","Crashes all the time. Once you've swiped to an area. Automatically zooms out. Horrible update","I haven't been able to use this app since the update. Full of bugs.","The new update disabled my search settings. App was amazing before","Hate the update. New one is way harder to use","I enjoyed using this app before this latest update. The map is awful to navigate, and the colour scheme is not friendly. I don\u2019t find it enjoyable to use at all anymore. Unfortunate!","App used to be great but since recent updates and changes it crashes all the time and is virtually unusable. There are also bugs when creating search parameters.","Their update broke a rather decent previous ap.","Don\u2019t know what happened in one of the past updates but for the last month whenever I go onto the app and click to change the date to look at new listings, it\u2019s all blank and you can\u2019t see the month, day or year. So this is extremely frustrating since we\u2019re trying to find a house. Before this update it was perfect. Please fix this!","Since the latest update this app is useless. I have been using it for several years to keep track of what is coming available that I can afford and it worked perfectly. Now you can\u2019t find anything on the app. When will you learn, \u201cIF ITS NOT BROKEN, DON\u2019T FIX IT.\u201d Change just for change sake is never better. Will not be using this app again.","From 4 to 2 stars for me with the latest update. \n\nThe latest update has a cleaner design with some unique interactions but is now more difficult to use. Seems like a ground-up redesign that didn\u2019t take the merits of the old design forward. We lost some great quality of life features (ie. now we have to reach our thumb to the top right to close images instead of just swiping it away). As for the main action I use the app for, Horizontal scrolling through the property listing and seeing the pins on the map light up is \u201ccool\u201d but its way more cumbersome to use than when we had all the tiles stacked vertically.  Where did point clustering go? What about filtering by # of stories? Why is maintenance fee hidden behind an accordion? \n\nFeels like we missed some user testing steps here or we needed a harder look at what the MVP should\u2019ve really been. Don\u2019t get me wrong I can still find places but this new update feels like it\u2019s made my house searching much less of a good experience that it was before. Yes, people hate change - but that\u2019s not an excuse - that\u2019s something you take into account when you roll out updates IMO.","When the new version was released it was a disaster, however stability was improved with a subsequent update. The most recent update has broken the app again, it crashes constantly even after deleting and reinstalling the app.","You guys should be ashamed of releasing the app of this quality to the public. The all crashes every 30 seconds (I have iPhone 6plus). I used to be able to view listings any area I was passing by, with the latest update I get listings from all over ranked by price. When I try to arrange them by distance the app crashes. It's been a couple of months and it hasn't been fixed yet. Shame on you!","after the last update, the app is not responsive and the way you browse pictures is very difficult.","New update on iphone 8se with ios 15.  When map is selected, a listing pops up and takes up half the screen making it almost impossible to see listings in the area selected.  It\u2019s an extra step to minimize the listing which i find not as useful as the previous version. \n\nAlso, the app glitches and I\u2019m forced to exit and restart.  Tonight it actually froze my phone (even the power button wouldn\u2019t respond).  Had to plug phone in and unplug my phone.\n\nI have since removed the app and will wait for a different update or app developer.","My favourites are all gone after the update!!  There is no login option anymore!","What a joke of an update. It doesn't even work...AGAIN.This is pitiful. What a sad excuse of an app. Worthless garbage.","Wow, new update that wiped my saved listings and seems to have gotten rid of search filters. Great update guys.","This app is seriously retarded since the update. The menu bar in the bottom is just behind the minimized button and always mis licking on this app. Everything about this is so wrong. As if the app wasn't struggling enough before the update","Almost unusable since update. Keep getting app errors while searching or getting to favorites.","This new app sucks. Apparently none of the techs read these reviews or even use the product. Have had the new update for a few weeks and the issues haven't been resolved.","This app is HORRIBLE since they updates. It's previous version with its old looks worked just fine and I loved using it, but the new updates are worthless. I can't even open the app anymore without it crashing in the first 30 seconds. In fact, I haven't been able to use the app for the past few months BECAUSE of these terrible new updates.","The new update makes it even harder to search. Worked perfect prior. Why they had to change?","Latest update is a step backward. Not very user friendly.","It used to be nice before the update. I am deleting it.","Awful update. I just removed the app. It's useless.","If you want to be able to share one account with your spouse then save yourself the frustration and use your computer or phone browser. Whoever decided to make this update should be embarrassed. And no you don't need to respond to tell me to look forward to future updates. I'm looking for a home now so later doesn't help. This update clearly wasn't ready so should not have been released","The app was easy to use and convenient until the latest update. Now it's extremely lagged and nearly impossible to navigate ... with the latest update. it's a confirmed method to frustrate ppl and make sure they switch to different platform. Whoever authorized this update needs to get fired or Realtor.ca will become the next Yahoo","Terrible update, clunky and hard to navigate throughout the app. As the industry leader and monopoly in the market, one would expect more for the update. The develop team definitely needs a crash course on user experience.","With the new update, text blends in with the background...drop downs are blank. It is absolutely not usable. Update broke everything.","This latest update absolutely sucks. Can\u2019t sign in.  Crashes all the time. Search function lacks clarity. Why would you update a perfectly functional app to this new piece of crap?  CHANGE BACK OR ALLOW USERS TO DO SO.  I\u2019ve used this for at least 5 years, with no complaints until today. You are forcing me to use the web where I must sign in each and every time. Absolutely ridiculous!!!!","This app use to be awesome but has become utterly useless with the new update. It crashes within seconds of loading. Get it together developers. If I could give this zero stars I would.","Very useful app. But the new version is super slow and often crashes. I think they released the update too early.","New update is crashing like crazy. I've uninstalled the app and reinstalled but it still crashes.","This new app or update is horrible. So limited on what we can do, used to be able to open the app where ever you saw a place for sale and find it, nothing shows up on this new update or app whatever this is. Please give us the old app back.","Since the last update this app always crashes when I search nearby with the map.  Very buggy app","Why why why why whyyy. The new update is so not user friendly. I hate it!!!!! Revert back immediately or I\u2019m heading over to Zolo for good.","Ever here of \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it\u201d\nThis new update is absolutely horrible. I will say it looks nice but it\u2019s 10 steps back when it comes to usability.","This newest update has made the app completely useless! No homes load. I\u2019m missing out on the hot market! Thank you, realtor.Ca but this is a dumpsterfire","Used this app all the time until the new update. Very difficult interface to browse, takes forever, you now have to swipe through every listing. Deleting the app, sorry. Terrible update.","The latest version buggy AF","The new update layout isn\u2019t the best, I liked how it was before. But please keep the edition of searching how much land you want.","App constantly calls out to crittercism.com After a recent update and doesn\u2019t function correctly if blocked.","The new update is awful. Terrible. Unusable\n\nThe colours are too dark. Switching between residential and commercial is not as easy as it once was. It was great before","I use this AP a lot, it has a lot of things positive but it clearly needs a few updates. I would love to be able to see the delisted home in favourites so that you can quickly see which one it was. Surprised that with all the recommendations people have made none of these updates have been made.","I have never encountered an update that makes the app this much worse. I can\u2019t even use it as it won\u2019t stop crashing. The map looks and functions terribly. You try to click on a listing and it takes you somewhere else. Honestly it would be better to restore the old version as this is totally useless","So your recommendation was to uninstall and reinstall if it was still crashing after the new update. Still crashes, so disappointed.","Update: still a useless app. Latest update is garbage. Photos still skip and now listings skip by 3 or 4. Favourites list sucks. New to old? Why? What happened to high to low and low to high. Top 1/3 if screen is wasted with a stupid comment. Horizontal isn't working. Give it up. Go back to vertical. Still an embarrassment to Canadian real estate. Drop this garbage app","New update crashes and fails.","It got worse after after new update.","These clowns still haven\u2019t reverted back to the original layout. This new update has been nothing short of pure garbage. Find the people responsible for this disgrace of an \u201cupdate\u201d and make sure they\u2019re cleaning toilets for the YMCA.","This is frustrating!\nBefore the update the app crashes when the map is zoom out beyond 3km radius.\nNow after the update, I could not even use the app, it crashes after loading.\nIf you people in the software team do not know how to fix a problem. Go get a job at a fast food chain, there you do not need to use your brain to solve any problems, yet people will keeping coming back for more of your sh!t.","Even with the latest updates it continuously crashes. \nAnd you can only email your favourites. Hard pass","Previous version was quite usable. Latest update changed the design and decreased usability. Not worth using the app anymore.","How can they update an app that was already a garbage and make it worse? Edit: there some good apps out there basing yourselfs on Zillow for example is not a bad idea","The latest update isn't better than the last. Keeps crashing and it's very buggy. \n\nFire the guys who made this and hire someone competent.","Recent update makes viewing photos on iPhone off centred and there is a irritating white boarder on the side and bottom reducing photo size.  I find most updates for this app typically make it worse.","Does not change floor area from metric to imperial!!! What\u2019s the point in even giving that option. Submitted to developer and got a snotty reply back!!! \nSince the last update, the app does not leave you signed in. Absolute P.I.T.A. When you\u2019re trying to see your favourites!","I have never used an app that has taken so long to load or crash as much as this Realtor app. I'm waiting for the next update and if it doesn't improve I plan on deleting it.","Not sure what happened but last update is now super challenging to view listings!!","New update is awful. I like to be able to search a large region on the map using my filters, not just a specific location. Seems to be no friendly way of doing this. I don't see any benefits to the new update, just makes everything harder.","ridiculously bad update. I wish I could give this app 0 stars","New update is not user friendly. House pictures at home page is taking over more than 50% of the page space. The dark background for the map makes it hard to navigate.","After this latest update the app will not stay logged into my account. When I exit the app it signs me out. This never use to be a problem","Is there a way to undo the latest update? This version is literally unusable. Terrible.","Had the app for a few years was  good, but the last few months is terrible i have to sign in every 12 hours or so since the last update needs fixed very badly i don\u2019t have time for this \ud83d\udc4e","The app doesn\u2019t take the full screen of my iPhone. Most likely not made natively or not updates for multiple years","When it works, it's a good app but it seems to constantly crash with every 2nd update. Already crashed 6 times this morning with the latest update.","Is this a joke? How can you make this worse with the update. Anyone involved in this abomination needs to be fired. More specifically try and use the app and you'll understand why it's terrible. Maybe this is why it's so bad you don't even know. How is the old app better than the new app.","Can't open the app at all after the update today. Worse now than before the update. Zero stars!!","Annoyed with the last update, keep having to log in each time I use it &amp; I\u2019m on it multiple times a day. Aside from that, love it. Very easy to navigate.","This app is horrible compared to the last version, very poorly done update.","This new update is GARBAGE!!!!! IT ACTUALLY SUCKS!!!","This was the most used app on my phone until the last big update.  Now I never use it...only on my iPad as I never updated that one.  Who ever thought this was a good update to go live should be fired.  I'm giving it 1 star as it's the lowest.","This app has become unusable with the last two updates.","Crashes immediately. Whatever update they did. They messed it up completely for me","Good up until the last update. I finally updated the other day and that was a mistake because now the app is so slow its basically unusable. I've rebooted, cleared the app cache, no change. Developers should be able to see my device info after this post.","Not enough search criteria that used to be there.. how do you consciously make an app worse with an update?","I have now done your latest update and it crashes faster then EVER!","Complete failure.  The app is totally unusable after the update.","Absolute garbage since last update..","Really one of the worse update I ever saw on an app!!!","Crashes all the time since the last update.","Has a lot of kinks.  Look for other apps in the mean time. New update doesn't eve let you open the app. Can we make zero star an option ?","This new update is so bad the map is slow and dark. I used to spend so much time on this app and it was easy to use now I can't even look at it anymore.","Garbage.. The new update is 10 steps backwards.... Totally useless. Switched to other apps now. Zero stars if I could.","Absolutely Garbage, the filters are gone, price range is gone. It is like a 2 year old did the upgrades. Basic, very basic. Don't update it, actually yes update it so you can see how terrible this app is","Update is worse than before, can't login and get saved favorites anymore.","Do not update","I use this app everyday and it doesn't matter what I do it crashes consistently. When I try to delete it and download it again it continues doing the same thing. Especially after a new update this happens. This needs to be fixed even if it means reverting it back to the original version.","New update is absolutely horrible. Barely use now and do not recommend until they switch back to an actual user friendly interface.","Who ever is in management approved this update should get fired.  Please bring back original app since this app really sucks!","This app seems to be updated quite often and nothing ever seems to be fixed. It's possible that it's actually getting worse. Take your time on your next update","This latest update sucks...no mortgage calculator makes this app no different than any other...before this update you could see all the relevant information in one place now this app become useless to me...I am personally deleting it if the next update does not return it to previous state...so disappointing","App crashes every few seconds. Horrible! Has been problematic for years, with each update released it never seems to improve. I don't understand why they can't get this right.","This new update is so bad I cant even tell you. You gotta reverse this new update. It's so inefficient and frustrating to view properties with this new update.","Wow, even worse than the last version!","Consistently crashes since latest update... Awful.","Not impressed with the recent update at all. The app had issues before the update, and now it's even worse. The map portion always glitches when trying to zoom in or out or when trying to click on a property to view it. It's very frustrating. The set up with the new update is also more confusing than before. I want to go back to before the update.","Used to love this app! It was so easy to use before. Since the update, they have now removed the function where you can see an estimated mortgage payment and it doesn\u2019t ever load the photos!!","Don't update","What a garbage update. An absolute downgrade, usability is far worse.","What a useless update","It\u2019s like their constantly updating this app to make it worse. The last few updates have lost some key functionality and doesn\u2019t seem like proper testing is performed prior to launching the updates. The searches don\u2019t always work properly now. I used to use this app quite often and am now looking for alternatives.","Just crashes over and over on launch since last update...","New update there no option to filter by price etc. C\u2019mon, how did you miss something so simple?

I type in MLS # and the app cant find the listings","Fix this trash app.","I feel like they\u2019ve given up on this app. Two months for an update and all they did was fix the values in the drop down menu.

The general design and functionality is improving, with one complaint being that there\u2019s no standardization for property measurements, and no filter option for it.

However search needs more selection. Please develop an iPad version.","The app is not working on iPad.  It\u2019s tilted and zoomed mobile version. Looks bad.","Due to the iPad app no longer available, I\u2019m giving them a 1 \u2b50\ufe0f.","Same app needed for ipad","I loved the gorgeous old iPad app that was replaced by the iPhone app.  Why did you replace it?  \n\nSo disappointing.","The app isn\u2019t optimized for ipad","Will not rotate on ipad...","Silly app. Am sure it works fine on a phone but doesn\u2019t scale for an iPad. So 2012....","I\u2019m looking at this on my iPad and I can\u2019t see things in landscape mode. My iPad has to be upright but that doesn\u2019t work with my iPad case. It\u2019s a pain to use this app on my iPad. Your old webpage worked just fine.

It can not be started?","This is an excellent app and works seamlessly on the iPhone however it would be excellent if there was an iPad version.

The app displays on an iPad screen in the size of an iPhone which is really crappy. On the website on an iPad 4 the location buttons of the listings can\u2019t be used.

At the very least add iPhone X screen support and bring back the iPad support!","App not compatible with the iPad","Make it so it goes landscape on the iPad...","Have been using this app for a long time.  Have bought and sold 3 houses using this, and have researched properties across Canada.\n\nThe latest version is terrible!  The colours make it almost impossible to read the map.  The type size, and grey on white of the description is hard ti read.  And the app crashes for no apparent reason (latest IOS on Ipad Mini 4), and you lose all your settings!  Applies to Ipad Air as well.  Information provided is much improved, and appreciated.\n\nA return to the old map format would be nice along with better contrast in the text.\n\nThank you","Old app is way better. The new version crashes every few mins on iPad mini, is very slow to respond on iPad / iPhone, the GUI is not as easy to use, does not rotate photos correctly.  Only nice thing is the ability to share a listing now functions as you would expect on an Apple device, unless it crashes while you are using it. \nI would give it zero stars if that were possible.","iPad?","For an organization your size it\u2019s pretty pathetic that your app is not optimized for iPad. I\u2019d like to see everything on a bigger screen but the app won\u2019t allow. Nice.","I have a keyboard that I use with my iPad so I do everything in landscape mode.  I hate apps that only work in portrait mode because it means I have to detach the keyboard to operate them. Deleting app; it just doesn\u2019t work well on the iPad","Excellent and easy to use and it works exactly as described. I'd like to see an iPad version of the application...","The app was just updated however the release is full of bugs.  I\u2019m using it on an iPhone and an iPad and in both cases the app closes up while you are searching on the map.  This needs lots of fixing as it is super frustrating to use.","I got the app for the Ipad and it comes in sideways - are you kidding me? You wrote it for Ipad and I have view sideways?\nThen they want email and user name - forget it I am deleting.","Ipad has been invented.","Why doesnt this app fill my ipad screen?","No landscape view for iPad","Needs to rework the app for landscape view, and it keeps crashing on iPad. Unfortunately it is the only app availabe.","Comes up the size of a phone on my iPad","Never understood why Realtor.ca eliminated the IPad version.\nHuge disservice to the realtors.","This new format (loaded on my iPad) sucks compared to the old format.","Trying to use this app on an IPad in landscape is useless and some genius there didn\u2019t think of making compatible with landscape.","I look at this on my iPad.  Even though my iPad allows rotating, I can\u2019t find how to unlock your site...like it\u2019s made for just a phone!  Really irritating.   The filters are cumbersome to use.  When I star a  listing as a favourite, and it is taken off the market, you leave the blank space where it was but no picture...just the listing ID, which is useless to me to know which favorite was removed.   Leaves me guessing.  You could have done a lot better.","Screen does not rotate when holding iPad sideways.\nNeed to fix this","PLEASE bring back the iPad version of the app.","I\u2019ve been using his app for years, updating as needed. Them out of nowhere, no properties will load. \n\nI removed and reinstalled. Now what? No longer made for iPad, but an iPhone app that needs to be expanded.

It just looks terrible at 2x the iPhone size. Apart from that I would recommend to all iPhone users!","The iPad app was useful. Now I have to use the scaled iPhone app... that\u2019s dumb.","This app doesn\u2019t work properly on an iPad.\n\nIt looks terrible. The fact that the landscape mode is not available is particularly bad since lots of us use the iPad Pro with a keyboard as a laptop replacement. Honestly, the app as it stands is not worth having.

I find it\u2019s awkward and only works sideways","It\u2019s 2018,\nRidicules app, full or bugs, cannot share properly. Resolution si terrible. Cannot use on (iPad horizontal). \nMobile means iPad too. What a waste.","The fact the only realtor.ca app is basically an iPhone only app with no iPad optimization is really weak.

Then the update happened and it was unusable.  Now working, but glitchy. Much better.","Always freezes, kicks you out during a search.

App not working at all, and it continues to crash.","Why all the changes?! The app was working perfectly, now its not even usable, and of course no way to get back before the update. Now I have to go on my computer to be able to do a proper search, really not a great move, especially now during all the individual looking for houses.. wow :(","Guys, this version simply isn't working!\nApple, you need to review apps more carefully, before releasing them upon us!","This used to be a useful app. The newest update made it so much worse to use. Terrible layout, not easy to find what I want. And now, it doesn't even open. Go back to the way it was. Working fine, and easy to use.","It appears they have regressed... perhaps because they want you to work with an agent and get matrix listings. The new app is terrible and has lost some functionality to search for things like duplexes etc. It is in no way better than the version it replaces... I urge people to give it a one star to send a message it needs a lot of updates... quick","This new app is now useless. Can\u2019t search by price range or new listings by date. It is FAR less user friendly- or even useful for that matter compared to the previous version.","Hate the update, can't search by MLS #. It keeps giving you suggested address. I don't need suggested addresses I just want to enter MLS #!\n\nthe map navigation does not work properly. And the landscape photos are so tiny, it doesn't show full screen.","The way search results are shown forces me to slide up all entries a bit to check the price and number of rooms... But not too much then the map is automatically hidden. At least the filters and map work very smoothly!","This app does not let you search for a certain type of home. I am unable to search for a bungalow which should be pretty simple. I'd rather go online and find a different avenue of searching for properties this used to be a little bit simpler for me until they updated it and discontinued the other app.","This app has some potential - who doesn't want quickly scan and search to read what's around?  \n\nThe map is definitely the weak point as it zooms in and out without control. It should stay in one spot while you're searching an area.","Luv the app....works great except I don\u2019t see \u201cvacant lots\u201d in the search choices anymore for some time....says agriculture land but no more vacant lots option!   Maybe I am not doing something right as everything else is grrreat\ud83d\ude0a","We need to know how much they sell and when the property in the market.\n\nActually I used the realtor app every days because I search for new home. \nVery good app. \nThanks","The whole app is broken. If I search Toronto Ontario it shows me the ocean. If I type in a specific address, it either can\u2019t find it or shows me the ocean. If I search a different area, you guessed it: either no dice or ocean. \n\nDon\u2019t bother downloading this.","Go back to the old app, this is practically useless unless you have spare time you like to waste. Search for Resisdential and get Vacant land is one of many issues with this app.","I never write app reviews - I just don\u2019t have the time. But after seeing the tragic (yes it really is that bad) downgrades across all features, I just had to put this out there. You can no longer search by # of bedrooms, bathroom, etc. You can no longer filter through custom price ranges as the type feature has been disabled. Properties are not always correct in regard to their geographical location on the map. The inverted map is difficult to navigate and the satellite toggle is impossible to use with ease. The app developers either failed to properly consult and challenge the update proposals or they don\u2019t use the app themselves and have no idea what they\u2019re doing. What an absolute joke.","Could be 5 star if they added year built search field","Can't seem to change the search radius (gives an error message). Otherwise it's okay.","App is frustrating to use. Can't search for specific addresses or listing numbers. Keeps ignoring my input and showing properties around me. Also, images when you get to a property are small and rotating to landscape makes it even smaller!!!!  Lousy app. Previous one was much better. Feels like a Web app with the delays in the loading and touch inputs.","Not even the basic search functions work such as selecting a detached. And every time you refine your search the ap adjust your search location on the map to some default zoom. You should have saved development $ and stayed with old ap. It worked.","Don't even bother downloading just use website you can save your searches or saved home don't waste your time with the app!","I just started getting into the groove using the saved search features. Now the whole interface has changed and it isn\u2019t intuitive at all. I usually don\u2019t write reviews but I\u2019m so annoyed with this right now. Please make this better. And please add in the ability to search for \u201cfreehold\u201d as well. I hate seeing condos in my searches. And the ability to search based on when it was listed.","The app was great prior to the recent updates. Now the search includes houses around the current are that the user is in. Not needed I think.","This app crashes quite regularly and I have to start my search from scratch.","No more sign in\nMessy showing prices all over the place on top of one another. \nLost all my saved searches","All the information you really want to have at your fingertips the brilliant mad scientist at Realtor.ca have moved to another couple clicks away. It\u2019s now harder to search by newly listed, literally the only feature I care for on this app. V3.0 it was 2 clicks. V4.0 it\u2019s 5 clicks! Property stats are now an extra click away, like land size, house size etc. It seems to be focused more on promoting the realtor instead of the property. Terrible version and it won\u2019t let me downgrade to 3.0. Booooooo","Not enough search functions.  \nI would love to look for garage AND pool.  But it gives me either.  And if the listing agent mentions \u201cspace to build garage\u201d it shows up as well.  \nThe app is a good start to find a property, but there should be a requirement to meet a minimum standard before you can post a property. Very frustrating when lazy agents don\u2019t post more than 2 pictures and no measurements.","Lots of the app is great, but there's no search history so everytime you close it or even just hit back a couple times you lose where you were and have to re-enter all your search criteria! Super frustrating.","I can't find an option to login and see my favorites and saved searches.","This app is no longer easy to use. The search options and filters are absolutely gone and there is no way to filter anything except a few options. Awful. Now I\u2019ll have to use the website and I will rarely use it anymore. Thanks for being another app that changes version for no reason and only for the worse ;)","App is completely unusable. I want to search multiple properties by clicking on an area, not being zoomed in and having to click individually multiple times!! What a waste of time, terrible UX, tiny tiny buttons and fonts, and wish I didn\u2019t get updated to this.\n\nDeleting this app and will use something else.","Where are my saved preset searches? Gone. Where is the ability to save multiple search defaults? Gone! But oh sure let\u2019s add fancy graphics which are slow and unnecessary! I am beyond furious. Please fix and add back the ability to save multiple searches! Plus which button is \u201cwaterfront\u201d? None of the options now appear to refer to this?","It isn't as user friendly as the previous version. I can't seem to search with the number of rooms and bathrooms. Additionally, I think showing the result horizontally gives a very narrow perspective of the search result. I prefer the vertical search result like the old version. The change is too drastic.","I rarely write reviews, but this is the worst update of any app I have ever seen. Why would you do this? Maps are cluttered and zoomed out way too much on a  search. My saved searches are gone as well as my ability to log in and make new. Wherever I touch on the screen when creating a search it defaults to search my area\u2026 I have no reason to force myself to get used to this. There is so much competition these days. .\nWhy would you do this? Did you consult any user before pushing it out?","How can i really search homes when i cant set nb of rooms and nb of bathrooms as basic options?!?","You guys need to do some serious changing there. The app is still crap. It won't even let me set any search filters it just goes back to default every time. Hire some real staff this is getting out of hand.","Where has the ability to log in, save searches etc gone?","Needs work. Realtor.ca used to have a very functional website. This app is just as frustrating as the website. Dots on maps never works. The maps miss properties and pull up properties from wrong areas. I have no way to search on my iPhone 7 and iPad for properties at your site unless I want to stress myself out. This means having to go to my desktop and even the website on the desktop is dysfunctional in that it erases searches even when I use the back button. Time for a makeover and take it back in time when it was so easy to use.","New updated Realtor.ca is NOT an improvement, listings are less informative then the previous app. The app will not hold the area I'm looking in and will give me an error notice, then flips me on the map to where I am currently located in the world, I have to scroll back to my search area all over again. So frustrating! The American Redfin app is much nicer.","Terrible \"update\" with the new app. Really frustrating to use. The map is difficult to use, and so is the image list of properties. I also don't like that you can only save one search, which automatically opens when you open the app. (I liked having a search saved for properties and one for vacant land) This app is not user friendly at all.","We all knew it was going to a worse experience than the old app, and we were right. Can't even search freehold/leasehold, and so many other options removed. Borderline a useless app now. Update to response: The search function is also a complete waste of time, tried it again thinking maybe I was too harsh but nope, this app deserves -5 stars. Specifically selected property search with garages and they showed me houses without, selected residential instead of condo and still got condos.","I cannot use the address entry search feature any longer. It will show the property I searched and then default to GPS location based properties on my location. Completely useless app if you are not in front of the property you want information on. This is likely why they force you to allow location to use the app and then remove the usability of the other search options and default to location based searches.","There is such limited search criteria on the app. It makes way more sense to use the website or another website.","Super disappointed they removed the option to search via ownership type.","Currently I really dislike the app but hoping that the developers read the feedback. Who provided the requirements? User experience is bad. I miss not having the ability to having more than one saved search. Please listen to your users!","Downgrade over the previous app. Can't log into your account so no information carries over. Search filters are \"prettier\" but slower to use and over all less effective. Looks were prioritized over function. Also I'm guessing it was outsourced overseas, as the default measurements is meters squared. When in practice everyone uses square feet for housing here.","What happened? This app used to be really good. Just recently it\u2019s been terrible. The search filters don\u2019t work. There are obviously some significant programming bugs that need to be fixed. Test first. Then roll-out.","Whenever I try to search by using the map it crashes and I have to restart it. It used to be better...","Even worse than the last one.. Constant crashes when trying to change the listing date. Searches not coming up. Virtually useless in its current state.","When I tried to search by listing number, it switched to another page to search by area.  So far it hasn't been working yet.","They make a garbage app and expect you to reveiw it so here we go, extreamly hard to use everything is dead slow, they give you filters that litterally do nothing, so many vacant land posts that its impossible to search the actual houses, and that is IF it doesnt crash first. Theres your review.","The update is horrible, all of my previous saved searches and favourites are gone. Impossible to navigate and the app looks way worse than before.","When I temporarily leave the app to check something about the listed property then return to the Real Estate app a minute later, it has reset itself and list all my search information. This forces me to start over and that is a pain and wastes my time.\n\nThe people who created this App obviously never use it!!!\n\nWhen I\u2019m searching for a property I get my listing information from this App for one property at a time, then I use a local Municipal website to check assessed value and to look at the municipal map, then I return to this realtor App BUT the damn app has now reset itself so I\u2019m forced to start over from scratch, re-enter my search criteria, then search again. I am forced to repeat this process for each property I intend to search. This is a very poor quality App that does not function the way people use it.","The latest update with new Search method is quite awful. There's no way to filter searches by # of bedroom, # of bathroom, sq. ft., etc... And if there is a way, it's not obvious/user-friendly.","It's a good app one big downfall. Im looking for homes in Ottawa, OntarioI put that into the search filter however I still get listings from Gatineau, Quebec. That's a whole other province.","What just happened? I made a huge mistake and updated the app.  My old version was so much fun to look and search. In this new version, navigation is unbearable and I can\u2019t seem to put in parameters for a more detailed search. What I\u2019m presented here is a clustermuck of endless information that is really irrelevant to me.","I like how ease to use this app. The major drawback is its stability. When I searched for something, it suddenly sent me back to home screen and I have to search all over again!","I used to enjoy having this app just for fun, finding listings and seeing prices ,having a goal to find a house in the future.... now I am just erasing it... I could not search anything without frustration \ud83d\ude43 sorry to the development team but this needs better UX research , nothing in this app is easy to use","Had the app and used it every day. The new app is not user friendly, especially if you\u2019re trying to search all listings in a specific area. I don\u2019t like having to zoom in and click on each individual listing instead of being able to see them all in one specific area. Deleted the app and now use my browser and the regular website.","you are better off to use mls website outside of the app. The map makes it impossible to search, it always moves back to your current location. Brutal.","Just downloaded this and used it for all of 3 minutes before quickly realizing why everyone says it sucks. The search is a disaster.","As an investor, it's difficult....I need better search categories for multifamily properties...for example, number of units, house class, year built...Things such as these.","This app is indispensable resource for Vancouverites, but it's plagued with usability-killing bugs. As most reviews point out, the map interface has a bad habit of zooming in and panning around every time you interact with it. \n\nAlso, the app doesn't seem to save any settings (and tends to throw a \"failed to sync account data\" error whenever I try to change a setting). This results in property information being displayed in metric (I prefer imperial) and search results being shown for a massive 3 km radius (I prefer to just see nearby properties, say within 500 m). The app has settings for each of these, but those toggles don't work in the current version, which is tremendously frustrating.\n\nUsers considering downloading this app may want to visit the realtor.ca website instead.","It crashes constantly &amp; there is no filter to search # of stories. That is once you figure out how to even use the filter. I only figured that out after I read other reviews. This app is basically not usable. The old app worked way better.","This latest update is definitely slower than previous versions, which makes it very frustrating to use. Also, the advanced search function needs to be addressed: when you select a residential house, you can't select \"detached\" or \"semi detached\". It defaults to \"attached\" every time.","This app still sucks! I don't know what this update did. you have to hit search like 4 times before you can search the city you want ! So annoying !","This app used to be easy, efficient and practical to use.  Now it is extremely frustrating,  can\u2019t set search criteria,  resets every time I enter details of a listing and try to return to list.  When is it going to be restructured?  \nYou had it right the first time.\nP.S.\nNow I can\u2019t even make a nickname that works to post this review.\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude21","Terrible new layout. Doesn't have the search options I want like the old app. Looks like pushing paid adds or something.","The previous app was a 5, this app is a 1. Took away all the ease and intuitive function. Have made it impossible to find properties using the search and map functions. I went from using the app weekly to only twice in 3 months and won't be using it again. Just horrible. Btw, whose bright idea was it to get rid of the waterfront option for those searching for a cottage?","Have been using this app for about 3 years. Has consistently gotten worse. Now does not search using the criteria you asked for. Criteria changes after you hit search. Should let you know when there are new listings in your criteria range. Should be able to message you with new properties meeting your criteria. Needs an overhaul.","App awesome. Only have one difficulty, which is to get rid of search nearby. When I type in another location, it reverts back to search nearby. Wish this could be fixed.","There is numerous accessibility issues. You removed various search criteria and I can\u2019t log in to save my favorites. This update was not well thought out","Inconsistent on when you can filter a search for number of bedrooms and bathrooms.","Forced logout Cannot login All saved searches gone No ability to add search filters on price, rooms etc. Wow. A special kind of awful\n\nWho on earth tests this before it\u2019s released to users!?","Map view keeps moving while you search. \nHas not improved. Use the Internet and NOT this app. \n\nJust avoid. Not worth the pain.","Reminds me of the 2000\u2019s. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t found anything similar. I just tried the search 4 times unsuccessfully. Just a terrible app.","Awesome app for tailoring a search to your specific needs/wants to find out what\u2019s on the market!","Once you could search by type and price and all the other wonderful choices. Now it\u2019s just ****! Better off searching on the website.","Map size changes almost constantly, images unstable, searches don't work.  What were they thinking.","The new version is very sleek and modern looking, but I can\u2019t figure out how to use it? I set my search preferences, but then it says there\u2019s no homes in my area, which I know isn\u2019t true. I was a big fan of the older version. I think this one has a few hiccups that need to be worked out.","Was just reading through other reviews and comments back...if you have to explain how to narrow down your search then the app sucks. It isn't clear where to do it. It took me a while to find it and I'm quite savvy with these things usually. With the old app it was so easy to use. If there was another option I would use that instead..painful.","This app now constantly puts up a notice which says don\u2019tShare my location or continue. Then the area that you have tried to search disappears and it returns to where you are located. Turning off the location finder in the settings for the app doesn\u2019t work either so for some reason it is now terrible to use and I am going to use another app to do my real estate searches.","Compared to other real estate apps out there (both Canadian and US ones), there\u2019s a lot of things that can be added or improved to make this a 5 star app.  As it is, I\u2019d give this a \u201cmeh\u201d rating.  Some things:\n\niPad support!\n\nProper landscape view\n\nMore filter options e.g. year built range, sq feet range, lot size range, number of kitchens, property view checkboxes (not single select option), multiple city search, etc.\n\nSaved search new listings alerts (e.g. via email or sms)\n\nAbility to delete favorite homes\n\nChange alerts to favorite homes (e.g. price drops, listing removed, etc.)\n\nSearch by drawn area\n\nImproved map view (e.g. when viewing large area, the dots showing the number of homes for sale is sometimes not placed accurately; sometimes numbers shown are incorrect)\n\nMore sharing options (i.e. not just by email)\n\nMore details and extra features shown for each listing.\n\nOffline mode (e.g. to view saved homes or searches)\n\nImproved or streamlined data use - somewhat a heavy data hog (reduce the size/quality of the photos?)","Seriously stop trying to do so much with this. Go back to what worked, simple search and map or list results. The constant crashing and errors while trying to search make this unusable.","Every time I search for properties in a city, search results always show up as no properties found. In order to search properties when searching by city I have to use the website. Very irritating. Also your saved searches and favourite properties don\u2019t work when using the app either. Uninstalling this app as it\u2019s useless.","Previous apps allowed you to sign into a single account and be able to share over multiple devices, this.... thing is self contained per device, what dumbness lead to that design idea.\n\nWhere\u2019s the saved searches\nProperty sharing amongst different devices\nOnce had more options to define a search\nSign in|out options\n\nJust stupid, if it ain\u2019t broke....","Curious who signed off on this as an improvement? Where did all my favourites and saved searches go? How was it not part of the plan to transfer those? Feels like a big miss... Not to mention the decreased search functionality... Is it possible to roll back to the old version? Cause I\u2019d much prefer that.","You changed the map to dark mode and there is no provincial boarders. The search features are completely changed too. Just terrible. I liked this app before this update and now I don\u2019t bother using it because it\u2019s not user friendly at all. So, so disappointed.","It needs some improvement. Sorting and filtering does not do the job properly. You can\u2019t setup perimeters to limit your search. Finance tools are not available.","It is very handy to use this app. I have a problem when searching. I input an area I want to search and it keeps defaulting back to where I live not where I want to search. It takes awhile to get the proper search so I save my searches to avoid that time consuming problem for next time I want to search a certain area and price range. It would be nice to share easier on Facebook or to send to friends. I do not like the website when it selects a red set area when I do a search as it usually is just in the edge of where I want to search and that is frustrating so I hope that feature does not appear in the app. Overall, despite all this, I do use this app regularly so it is convenient. But fix these problems and it would be even better.","Terrible changes to the app. You can\u2019t save differ t searches and half the time you get 0 results.  When you search the same on the website there are many results","Ridiculous... and looks dated overall.  On the positive the search functionality by map is good.","The previous app worked fine. This one has a horrible user interface and is buggy. The photo scrolling on this version never works (doesn't lock on actual pictures). No ability to quickly switch between imperial and metric in listing details. Can't figure out how to filter search results in map mode.","It is fantastic that I can look up all realty listings in all areas of the country. Ease of use it is great. It would be nice to have the ability to narrow the search critic down by house style. Or 2 story, bungalow etc.","I'm very happy with the new update! Searches are now filtering out many unwanted results now and it will be much faster to use. I really like being able to see my favourites on the map. I still think a proximity search would be useful for people trying to stay within a reasonable distance to work and loved ones. I'd also like to be able to save multiple searches again. Great work, thank you!","Awful update / new app They have taken away so many features that made searches easy. You can't move from the location to a near by area, search options are not the same. You use to be able to use a map and look at the area in the map, but now nothing shows up outside the boarder it draws. Thank you for your response. I tried all that and that didn't happen or work.","Found the old app much easier to use. Really miss the search listing's by date posted feature.","The presumption that I want to search for listings \u2018near me\u2019 is either completely asinine( by an app developer who knows nothing about buying behaviors of the public) or as a lame attempt to collect location data. Newsflash: people don\u2019t buy in the area they are in especially when they are an investor. As far as your search criteria the fact that you do not have the square footage ranges of the property as the primary item is appalling. And who thought it was a good idea to have two categories named \u2018residential\u2019 and \u2018condo/strata\u2019 are you unaware the people living in condos....reside there? You should call it \u2018detached homes\u2019 as is the linguistic norm. Last but not least, who was the genius who thought it was a good idea to provide lot measurements in.....hectares. Perhaps in rural India where this app was likely conceived this might be a \u2018thing\u2019, in this country we have always and will always use acres and fractions thereof particularly in light of what the average residential lot size is. This app is a terrible reflection of the Canadian real estate profession, if it\u2019s the best that the millions of dollars the association collects from its tens of thousands of members can come up with in the almost third decade of the 21st century.","New set up is annoying to navigate. I'll find another way to look for houses since the app never seems to satisfy. I liked the way it was before better than the new layout. All you had to do was fix the bugs &amp; search options. I'm done trying to use this silly app","When we click on search area, it just open Location based map, Can not search by Listing# \ud83d\ude1f","Every time I click the search and type an address I want, it just automatically reverts to my current location. Therefor, you cannot search by mls # or address, you have to find where the house is on the map to look it up. \n\nAlso, who in Canada uses hectares as a standard unit of measurement.  When you first click a listing it shows as acres and then immediately reverts back to hectares and there\u2019s no way to change that. I don\u2019t understand. App doesn\u2019t let you filter your search by acreage either as you can on the website. \n\nTerrible.","Every single piece of info should something I can search for.  Used to be able to search for detached versus semi-detached. No more.   This app used to be much better a year or two ago. Will stop using and find another real estate app. \n\nCrashes all\nThe time.","This app used to be quick, intuitive, and simple. Now having to click 5 times to view a house when zoomed out is a pain. Can no longer save multiple different searches. It no longer centers on your location on map at first, its just a random spot.","Hitting the search bar doesn't actually allow you to type anything but yet does a search anyway. Pretty useless app and I'm not sure why they're promoting it in its current state on their site.","Wow .. I can\u2019t even get off the initial page where you agree to terms ... same  as the desktop completely unresponsive .. can\u2019t go back .. on iPad anyway , not user friendly at all ... how do yo set up a search ??

Search unreliable","Works ok but lags behind the previous app. For example, you can't search only waterfront property","Can only search for 1M+ at 500k intervals. That\u2019s a big range.","1) when searching on a map it constantly recentres and resizes your window and you completely lose track of where you are\n\n2) sending a message to a realtor errors out unless you hit the right checkbox in the right order\n\n3) frequent random crashes\n\n4) my saved searches do not work\n\nReal sloppy.  Test the app thoroughly before your next release please.  It is important to us as it is the only way to search for listings. Come on guys","Not nearly as good as the big US apps. Doesn\u2019t show listing or sales history. Search function is glitchy.","I can't understand for the life of me why they have forced us to download an app that seems to still be in testing phase?? No option to log in, not user friendly, search feature is ok but I preferred the old setup. Uninstalled it right away, so useless to me.","Update: your response doesn\u2019t even make sense because you CANNOT narrow your search by number of bedrooms/bathrooms like you used to be able to. I looked where you said to look and it is not there. You don\u2019t even know what your own app does.\n\nWhy is the map blue-on-blue? If you live somewhere with many lakes, it\u2019s hard to even tell where the land is and where the water is. I don\u2019t want to use the satellite view as it\u2019s too cluttered looking. Much less search filter ability. Can\u2019t even choose how many bedrooms/bathrooms? Isn\u2019t this a simple filter? The only plus with this new app is that I haven\u2019t had it crash at all, whereas before it happened quite frequently.","All my saved properties, searches and realtors are gone with the update","WHY would I only want to search the area I am now ???? It is a site to find a new home. That likely involves going beyond the immediate area. Crashes constantly. What a piece of junk. DO NOT INSTALL.","I wish I could search by the number of acres I\u2019m looking for when looking for a property and not just when it\u2019s vacant land.","1. Fire your developer for not testing or actually delivering an ap that works.\n2. Start over - it's not rocket science Ana your old app could at least search properties - this one just always shows all props and take long to load if at all. #fail","Your update lacks proper UI workflow.  Who on earth suggested this makes sense. Increased clicks. High space usage with image browsing off of results. Miniature fonts in menu, requiring nails to select. \n\nWhomever guided this \u201cupdate\u201d, is either a new contractor or you\u2019re trying to add slick, over function. This can\u2019t be used in the field, for quick what\u2019s near me. Not to mention many other easy to use features.  \n\nThis update provides one assumption, you want to remove the ability of consumers from searching and using your app, and force them to get an agent.  Or, you want everyone to use another app.  \n\nGet back to basics and function over newness.  This is not an update, this is backwards.  Lastly, go back to drawing board and look at your competition\u2014 or similar apps in the USA. Europe or here.  They work, very very well and with more features, without sacrificing an easy to search, filter and results based UI.  \n\nTime to uninstall.","Using this app on a tablet is a waste of time. If you have a search with over 2 pages of results, the list will not load. I\u2019ve tried this on multiple tablets in our home and it\u2019s the same each time. Just use a computer.","The latest release took my rating from a 4 or 5 to a 1. Terrible UX experience now.

New UI makes this non-usable and I go on computer now.\n\nThanks for the reply, but the options are still not as user friendly as the previous version. Listen to the resounding feedback. I no longer use this app on my phone. I go to the website but will start using other apps if a solution is not in place shortly. Having a quick link to new listings, and also being able to save various searches was very beneficial. The navigation on the map with it jumping to selection is not as good as it used to be as well","The fact that this search filter was removed in the latest update is bonkers. If someone doesn\u2019t want to search condos, they don\u2019t want to see condos!!!! It was called \u201cownership type,\u201d and Freehold was the option I\u2019d always select!! Sounds, from other reviews, that this wasn\u2019t the only search filter that you removed. Makes no sense. Far worse for user experience.","Everything about this new version makes searching and viewing listings more difficult, slower, and frustrating. The ability to save multiple searches is gone - replacing it with a single \u2018Default\u2019 search is not sufficient, and the default doesn\u2019t seem to save anyway. I\u2019ve had to reset it three times. I hope realtors across Canada are screaming bloody murder about this complete failure.","This new app is waste of time. No login, so the saved searches, favorites are missing. This is like 4 levels of downgrade.","All around crap. Nothing, and I mean nothing works. Search for a city in NB and I get Winnipeg.

Map difficult to read and navigate. Am looking at alternatives.","It\u2019s shocking how poor this app is. New version doesn\u2019t have saved searchs, map navigation is awful","What happened? I\u2019ve lost all my saved searches... I can\u2019t login from the app... and the \u201cdark\u201d theme should be optional","If I could give 0 stars I would. This design is not user friendly, it does not easily allow you to search for new properties in a specific area via map.

Can't filter the search. Deleted because I am constantly cursong it when I use.","Terrible map. It's all shades of blue too dark and hard to see.

Stupid Realtor.ca - I would have liked to use a Realtor-legitimized search but they've \"shot themselves in the foot\" with this app.","Most painful app I've ever used. Crashes constantly. Once you allow them your location is near impossible to search other areas. Has great potential.. Just need to fix them bugs..","Latest update has introduced numerous problems. \n\nError messages frequently pop up when trying to use the search box. \n\nUnable to explore the map - the map is constantly snapped to where houses are, preventing you from exploring subdivisions on your own.","This app shuts down every time I use it.

The only thing missing is the ability to be more specific in searches (like water front properties, or homes with pools etc).  Otherwise, awesome app.","It works perfectly. And the fact you can save your favorite properties and searches makes it even better. Highly recommended.","Much more useful with the new version especially with the favorites and save search feature. Only thing I can ask for is more information in the details page such as room dimensions.","Overall ok if searching by map and using filters.  But the actual search box is useless.  If you input an address it auto corrects to a local area and deletes the selected or inputted address.

But lost ability to save searches and link to online account. Don't bother.","Easy to use and good app to get to properties I wanted to look. The only thing is I could not refine my search for commercial properties, land and such. But overall fantastic.","I\u2019m sorry, but the updated app is a huge FAIL for me. From the dark map to the super busy clump of priced results that show up when performing a map search, its just plain annoying. The previous version was far superior. . . it was less complicated, more streamlined and nicer to use.","Search function is terrible. Trying to search by listing id. Won't work. Search actual address. No listings come up. The only way I can find the listing I wanted was through map function. Have had same issue with your website. Really limits what one can find and encourages me to search alternate sites.","The money made by realtors and mls you would think their app would be more reliable. Crashes and a terrible search function lead the complaints.","Like many other reviews. This app has many bugs. That in many updates has not been addressed. Search options do not function well. And staying in same area search may kick you all the way to square one with one push of the button, when you think you're just going back to previous screen. Previous versions worked much better but there isn't really any other better option in Canada to search for current listings. These lazy developers have the market cornered \ud83d\udc4e","Long time user of previous app. I used to have five saved searches that I accessed regularly. New app does not seem to have saved searches, only the ability to set a single default. I want to be able to quickly and easily search for listings in multiple locations in different cities without having to set up the search parameters each time. Header takes up way too much space. Not a good first impression.","New update took a bit to get used to. Same functionality but it took a bit to figure out where everything is. Not as intuitive as the previous version. Problem is that it\u2019s broken now. You can\u2019t search by date listed, it just crashes now. The developers need to be on the fix ASAP as the app is useless right now.","This app is absolutely terrible. No matter what selections you make it only shows you properties based on your current gps location. If you try to search by ID number it just takes you to the location screen. If I could give it zero stars I would. Frustrating and completely unhelpful.","Each time I search for properties it just searches and searches and never actually displays the listings. Sometimes if I exit and go back in it works, but not usually.","The filters are blank, and the app wont let me type anything in them. And I didn\u2019t get to the notifications part if there is any at all. I would love to get notifications when something comes on the market that matches my criteria. Instead, I have to search daily.","Old one was much more user friendly. This new one is so hard to use. Its just bad. Cant save searches. Really not intuitive or even quick to use. Lots more scrolling and work to get to the info u want","A good app just got a whole lot better with today's update. Being able to save searches and tag favorites is going to make the search for a place to hide during the Zombie apocalypse much easier now.","When you are doing searches and you select the fields they go blank so you don\u2019t really know what was chosen.","The latest upate of the app completely changes everything. Functionality that existed in the previous version no longer exists. There\u2019s no option to login and all of my saved searches and notifications are gone. Filtering is frustrating and navigation is even more frustrating. If they thought they were improving the app they are mistaken. They\u2019ve made it worse. It wasn\u2019t a very good app to start with and now it\u2019s basically useless.","There\u2019s a bug with the options when trying to filter your search where they just appear as blank boxes. Can\u2019t seem to fix it on my own.","The app resets after switching to another app and coming back to it - have to search again.","The update is a downgrade. Can\u2019t search for just bungalows anymore?? Less search functions and the user face is choppy and not intuitive at all.

And now I can't search for anything","Comparing to the old app Search menu not only has less search options it is harder to specify your search, they seem to have spaced out minor things to the whole screen. Makes no sense less stuff should be easier to navigate anyways I would like all the search options available again unless I just havnt found them.","Can\u2019t filter results - there is a glitch that won\u2019t allow any filter selections","App is a joke.

I've opened four times now on 3G network (each time letting it search by location services / gps with full signal bars) for properties for sale in my area... and have yet to get a single reading. Cant even get a map to appear other than a blue dot (my location I assume) that keeps moving every 30 sec with no streets/ map? When I tried to use the map of Canada to search, every time I resized to narrow in on the geographic area I wanted, the map jumped halfway across the province. Once at Toronto it kept jumping to the middle of Lake Ontario. So far a completely useless app. I'm going back to web MLS.","Best house searching app out there you can do a really wide search you don't need to zoom to much like oder apps","This app is not bad, is there an address search icon?","This app has become my Realestate bible.

A+","This has the best search criteria of any home search.","Very handy. I love how you can instantly find properties in your neighborhood without having to do a full search. Very convenient!!!!!!","My phone automatically downloaded the new version last week and it\u2019s brutal. The app crashes lots, especially while changing search parameters. And the way that properties display in the ribbon is annoying compared to the old version which made it quicker and easier to hone in on a single listing or a tightly grouped set of listings.","Terrible app needs work to become great.\nI deleted after an hour of use and poor results.

The saved searches are a nice touch.","Latest update changed the interface and search features for the worse, difficult to view acreages now and the dark coloured map is strange. You can switch to satellite view but prefer the old map style. Search features were removed in the last update, including freehold land (to avoid condos) that we use all the time. We can\u2019t use the app to look for an acreage anymore, unfortunately.","Great for viewing properties but every now and then when you are putting in filters to narrow down the search it will crash, close the app. Then you have to start over. \n\nNot the end of the world just a bit annoying","App is very basic compared to other property apps I've seen and it still has numerous bugs. Given so few property details are entered correctly it is not possible to search accurately. Eg condos listed as houses. Why also is the price search criteria so inflexible? Why can't I just enter my own specific price range?? Why no link to tax assessed values?","Can only see 9 out of the total number of houses in every search. Get with it you guys.","This new update took a thoroughly enjoyable experience and ruined it! The search is garbage, the app itself keeps crashing and is now something I really don\u2019t like to use. On top of that, I\u2019ve lost all my saved favourites and have to start over, all while the app crashes whenever I search. Garbage, avoid like the plague.","Really like this one. Would be cool if you could set it to alert you when new properties come on the market that meet your search criteria.","The new mobile platform is awful. Really bad.  Background is so dark can\u2019t see anything. Search is difficult to use. The recent one was so easy to use. Someone needs to lose their job over this one.","This new version doesn\u2019t have the saved search feature so I have to go through the search process every time to find properties.  It\u2019s also not as user friendly as the previous version overall.  \n\nWish there was an option to revert to previous version.","This app is painfully slow to navigate and do searches. \n\nThe previous app had a better layout for search criteria (ie. building type, rooms, ownership, etc.)\n\nI\u2019m going back to using www.rew.ca on my mobile web browser until they fix this app.","Fix it back!

When you didn't think the other app could get any worse, Realtor.ca said hold my beer. You can't sort based on any parameters other than price or new listing. Can't filter based on price, bedrooms etc... You can apparently do this but it's not in a reasonable spot (hidden in menus) and can't be adjusted, you have to search again. Complete garbage.

It's a great help but I wish I could search by street (or figure out how to!)","The new interface makes a 2-step process into a 5-step process and eliminates saved searches?

Consistently leaves houses off the search.","The app doesn't load listings half the time when I scroll down. Also malfunctions when I use more specific search criteria. I usually use rew but they don't have listings in the Okanagan. Also had trouble sending my review when I was finished.  Had to redo it several times.","Must have for home buyers. I would have given it 5 stars if I could search for land size.","App is very handy on the go and links nicely to Safari for Realtor websites. I wish you could filter searches further (i.e. townhouse, apartment, detached, fireplace) like you can on the web based search, but otherwise pretty good!","As you can see from previous comments the update is very poorly designed. Saved searches are all gone now, and no longer able to customize my search without the app crashing. Wouldn\u2019t recommend","Before the update was fine. Now if you search a house within a price point it and waterfront and land it shows all some weird subset of homes where most shouldn't be listed.","The version 4.0.9 closes repeatedly as soon as a search is a little demanding. Very annoying.","No longer easy to navigate. Constant crash of app on my iPad have tried deleting app and reloading to no avail. Really has become useless in trying to search for a property in an area. Must select each and soon as I do, the app crashes and I have to start again.

Go use HouseSigma instead.","Really helpful and easy to search\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","This is a nightmare of an application. I can't search outside my city. Deleting searches and preferences is of no help. Why would I sign up and provide my email address when I have already downloaded the app? Why would I connect this app to Facebook, or my Google account?

Easy to search and save favorites.  Great job to the developers :)","Clunky, crashes, all my favourites are gone, nowhere to save multiple searches, not intuitive. Booo! Wrecked a good thing.","Like a lot of the features. Searches are quick and easy. Sometimes loading pictures can take a while or result in connection error. But great app!  Now I know who in my area is selling.","Great app, but it doesn't get 5 stars because I can't exclude condos from my search. Searching for 'Residential' automatically includes condos, giving me many more entries than I care to go through. Strangely enough, I can do a search *only* for condos, but not vice-versa.","Keeps saying no properties can be found and when it does find properties it\u2019s usually from one of my other saved searches that I did not click on.  This app is kind of no use to me so I\u2019ll just keep going to the website","I\u2019m a real estate investor and every once in a while I check the app to see if they have improved it but they haven\u2019t.  The website allows you to have notifications and searches actually return results where the app does not.","Can't filter results now. I search for houses with garages for $400k and still have apartments for $100k with no garage show up. Fix this!","Couldn't find parameterized search. So far it seems like it finds you everything, which really I don't need. Loved the old app ui better.","The previous version while not the most aesthetically pleasing was super functional. Newest update makes it hard to filter and search. Recommend using an app called House Sigma instead.","So now you can only save one search. The map is some weird featureless blue colour with no landmark features like shopping malls, park names etc. Or you can select satellite image still with no landmark names. Most older features are still there but buried in random selections. Annoying redundant update.","The search filters no longer work properly.  Adding price filters gets you seemingly random results.  Might still be useful if you're looking in rural areas.  Sifting through several hundred results in to find what you're looking for in a city is annoying to say the least.  Avoid this version.","The app used to work great however one of the updates ruined it. The search functions seem to be all messed up. \n\nIf I search within a price range, it shows me homes not anywhere near price range I entered.  \n\nThee are other minor search functions not working as intended but the one I already mentioned is the most obvious and irritating one. \n\nWhen it used to work properly, 5 stars. Now basically useless.","Similar to what others mentioned, when there are a lot of results for a search, only can see a handful (ie 8 out of 156).   The other major pain is sharing, or lack off.   Even using the email function, most times don't receive it on my side or recipient's.   Much easier to integrate into the iPhone's sharing.   App hasn't been updated in a number of months even after a lot of complaints.  Too bad, as it's it could  be a great tool.","I love this app, for detailed searches you need to use the computer but for a walking version, I think it's perfect!  And free!","The latest version is a step backwards. Less search functionality and filters. No longer able to save favorites and searches.","What were you thinking?  Did you even do any user testing at all?  The update is terrible!!!

Needs to be fixed.","Stupid app won't search what I want!!! I put in specific search criteria and it shows me everything I DO NOT want!!! Horrible!! Don't download unless you want to see every single house you'd literally never buy.","Next version should offer better refresh rates and allow to search in different neighborhoods more seamlessly. Over all, this is a great app that's made my house searches a lot easier.","The searches (3 bed, 2 bath for example) don't work on the app. Still shows all bedroom/bathrooms and dollar values. Makes it frustrating to use the app. Needs to be updated and fixed.","If you try to filter your results (building type, bedrooms, etc) the filter options don\u2019t show up","Very happy with this app. Gives you the ability to search listings very easily!","The app doesn't give nearly the same results as the website.  Can't search for property based in lot size like the website. Often get zero results or it crashes.  Very frustrating.","It\u2019s hard work.  The t&amp;cs when you login, who cares! Seriously we just want to see houses for sale.  If you\u2019re that concerned about litigation put up a disclaimer at the bottom of the page. Don\u2019t subject me to scrolling down. \n\nThen the search feature is pony. Come on really.  How can you make it so tedious and the ability to go back is again pony! I can\u2019t go on with this review.  For a site so pervasive in Canada could you do a worse job??","Make your app moveable to external storage/SD. Never stays on my phone long past one or two searches as a result.","Downgrade, not an upgrade. The new app is hard to navigate and not user friendly. You cannot login (therefore you've lost your ability to share your favourites with someone else), can't save more than one search. It's hard on the eyes when you are trying to look at the map(very cluttered). The list option was a better option than the carousel or map. I am not sure who approved this new app, but these major issues should have been sorted out prior to canceling the old app.","I used this app everyday for years. I now have tried very hard with the new update and absolutely HATE it. Instead I go into the website rather then use the app because it\u2019s completely not a user friendly app to use. I had hoped more narrowed down searches would be added but instead it\u2019s taken away even more options and made it a nightmare to use! I\u2019ll leave it for a bit in hopes it gets fixed but this app is currently a fail and will be deleted soon otherwise.","A downgrade from the discontinued version. The app crashes if you filter based on date listed, making it impossible to narrow down the search to latest listings.","I hate it when i set my settings to imperial and every time i go back into the app the measurements default back to metric. Also the \u201chouse\u201d setting keeps bumping back to all every time i go back into the app and then i get all the duplexes which i don\u2019t want to see. And this is using a saved search.

It forces you to find neighbourhoods but that's not the most helpful when looking for something specific.","Crashes all the time. \nSearch indicates that I can search by list ID but won't.","So difficult to use, challenging to search properties not in immediate area as it always refocuses on properties near you. Get with it please.","In the Search a Realtor feature, once you search and pick the realtor they have removed the option to see properties available by that office!","I think this app and website are great and user-friendly. However, I wish it had one more search criteria: Year Built. I would love for there to be a search function, like price range, for a range of when a house was built.","Terrible. You must basically restart a new search each time you click on a property. Garbage. We Went back in time folks.

Search parameters are constantly reset, makes for a very frustrating search process. As many users have said before, the update did nothing to fix this app.","No idea why, but even after the hassle of trying to sign in/up, my search has No Properties somehow despite being a pretty basic search. Shame, this app would\u2019ve been useful!","For the commercial search you don\u2019t give enough information.  50% of rent is TMI or Additional Rent and you don\u2019t display it. You also doing have enough filters to search square footage and specific areas. \n\nOn the residential search there is no filter anymore for water front. I think there was before.","Trying to search by ID and the box always expect an address. Somehow useless. The rest is pretty average, prefer to use the desktop version.","App won\u2019t keep me signed in, so it\u2019s very frustrating to have to sign in each time I want to favorite a property.

It\u2019s been this way for months.","Old app allowed to easily do a search of a City or Neighborhood and then easily see all listing in that area. This new app just makes you do more to see less, that is not progress imo.","The new one is brutal, can't even find a way to log in, the interface is so confusing, made to look simple but it's not simple at all. Really bad app. I can't find my saved searches neither.","Love how I can look up houses wherever I am. But often it is very glitchy and won\u2019t let you scroll down to see more listings.

When searching a large area and you click on a group of listing in area..it makes you zoom back out to see full map again after viewing listing. Seems to be also missing \"no preference\" option. Does search function allow you to search between dates? Or anything before/after a certain date?","Deleted the app 5 minutes after downloading. Has none of the functionality of the website. Won\u2019t let me sort by \u201cnew to old\u201d listings. When I try to search in the area where I am looking for a house it says nothing available because it\u2019s trying to search in my current location. But if you turn location services off the app is useless. Try harder next time realtor.ca.","There are no features. I cant find a login area to pull up my saved favorite. I cant find any filters to narrow my searches. I wont be using this app. I would like the old one back.","The new app no longer allows you to log in and see all of your favourites and saved searches. Very disappointed with the new version.","Zooms in on the map when you don't want it to, if you have a listing number already and just want to type it in the search bar prepare to wait a minute and have to tap the search bar 10x, if you're scrolling through thumbnails of homes you selected on the map and want to go back to the map dont hit back! You have to select the little map icon on the right, if not you start over","This app is progressively getting worse. The search feature will search an address or listing number and then provide you maybe the area where that address is. Rather then letting you choose the listing. The app since the last update crashing and freezes all the time on IOS. When you scroll across an area if you aren't quick enough to scroll again it will search the area and delay the move.","This new realtor design is very flawed and buggy. Keeps crashing when trying to do a search. \nListing date search is especially buggy.","If you delete the app and re-install it, it works fine. If you didn't create a Realtor.ca account, you will lose your favourites and saved searches. Most inconvenient to have to re-do, so still poorly done.... but fixable.","Who ever makes this app is perhaps the laziest development team I\u2019ve ever encountered.  Once Zillow picks up more steam in Canada this app is toast. This app reeks and it has for years. Reasons below:\n\n1. There is now way to removed places from \u201cMy Favourites\u201d. Once a place sells it just becomes a tombstone in your list that you can\u2019t remove. \n\n2. Default search area is where you are, no way to change this\n\n3. Inconsistent info on each listing. I understand this is each Realtor\u2019s responsibility, but the app should force them to fill out more info before accepting a listing\n\n4. After $1,000,000 listing the price search increments start jumping by $500,000. Not helpful","If I could give this app lower than 1 star rating I would! The old app was better. The map is dark and cluttered - why? Not everyone uses the satellite feature until they find a location of interest. The headline wastes room on the screen and the popup of \"homes in your area\" is not a feature that I like crowding my search. There are no settings to turn that off either. Please revert back to the old layout and add your \"new features\" to it as preferences for the user. Why fix what wasn't broken?","This app is completely useless! What was wrong with the last version? When and if this app actually loads it closes within minutes while trying to search and view properties. Btw, the new search tool is not user friendly, suggest fixing all bugs before you release next time","Really wish there were more granular search options in the land size category. All or 1+ acres is just not specific enough. Some apps let you search by .5 or .25 acre etc. If you are looking for places with a larger yard it would be very helpful.","New update search features are more doesnt translate for listings, so i ask what\u2019s the point? Oh and if you widen the search on map to fast it the app shuts down... the app literally only has one job, to let people searching listings and it can\u2019t even do that anymore!!!","Zooming in/out or moving the search area (even minutely) makes the app freeze. Selecting a group auto zooms to those listings which is incredibly annoying. Can't access favourites (listings or searches). What good is a mobile app if you can't actually use it on your mobile?","I reinstalled the app because it wasn\u2019t working properly.  Now it\u2019s even worse.  It won\u2019t rotate with turning the iPad.  There was no place to select a city location for the search.  That\u2019s all I could see before I got frustrated and quit my search.  Who ever is designing your apps should reconsider their career choice...","Format still hasn\u2019t been updated for IPhone X, XS and XR. Search filters at bottom of map are frustratingly difficult to use. Sometimes crashes.","App consistently crashes.  Have had to repeatedly reinstall.  Crashes on listing properties, listing favourites on app initialization.  Favourites get wiped out each time app is reinstalled.  Can no longer save list of preferred agents.  Search filters not as robust as previous version.  This appears to be pre-beta.  No way this is release ready.  Not happy...","Makes it impossible to search using the map. How was this app allowed to be released!","Realtors are giving this app 5 stars... And one review even advertised for himself (typical). Yes i agree that it is about time CREA spent their \"hard earned\" money (from their ridiculous  realtor fees) to catch up to 2010, but what a waste of my fees (yes i'm a realtor) to create an app that can't even include a link to the property one would be interested in to their agent.\n\nI just did a quick search near me and only one property was for sale among 4  towers, which is not correct.\n\nWhat a scam... As usual. Another reason why the real estate industry gets a bad rep. Btw, this is the ONLY app you can search the mls because of CREA's monopoly.","I am so tired of this site. Every time I set up search criteria, it always loses something and I have to keep resetting it. So annoying. If I didn\u2019t have to use this site, I wouldn\u2019t.","Would be helpful to be able to search by address.","This app is great - love how u see all the pins and can click each and shows pic of house if available before opening fully. Everyone is right and could use filter for narrowing search but on the right track!","Best way to search properties.","Can\u2019t believe this app never gets improvements. The search criteria selections are now blank with the newest update. This app is painful to navigate and crashes often... Glad I have a realtor!","Great app! I've read lots of complaints but I find this app is fast, has no trouble loading and actually works just as good as the pc version, all at your finger tips. I can see how some are upset about not being to search for duplexes cause there's no option but oh well, I'm not interested in that anyway so this things perfect for me","When the app got updated I was logged out and there is nowhere to sign in again. I never got the sign in page that is shown in the pictures. No way to retrieve my saved searches or my favourites. Not a very functional app. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb","Worst app I have used. Way worse than the last version. You cannot log in your profile. You cannot save your search. Layout ok the app is pretty bad.","App crashes a lot!\n\nWould like to be able to filter my search by: detached, house.\n\nGreat start to this app!  Can't wait to see future updates!","This app is great for house searchers or market watchers. Best part is the near me location search. Needs some refinement but overall is pretty good. Would like to see search entry not deleted when back button hit. Perhaps some favorites and compare lists as well as ability to switch to sq feet and meters squared.","Crashes when going into certain properties with filters used in search.","I find the search option doesn't work well at all. I also hate that you don't show which property has been sold, like you used to. Now, I have to search the mls number in google, then hopefully find a photo. Very annoying.","This update features a new interface which hides all the properties behind a single photo \u201ccard\u201d so you can only view one at a time, removes the ability to log in and save searches &amp; favourites across devices, and makes maps smaller an less convenient to use. A huge step backward in usability - as though the developer wanted to force you back to working with a realtor over the phone. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t updated, don\u2019t.","I originally gave this app a 4 out 5 stars but after using it a bit more extensively I have to take a star away and give it a 3 out of 5.  The concept is great but just a bit poorly executed.  Even mls.ca has it own flaws.\n \nAnyways, some of the things that I would like to see added, modified, or fixed are:\n- performance: the app can be extremely slow at time when loading maps or images, especially the smaller thumbnail images that appear in the search results\n- occassional crashing when viewing listings\n- the ability to switch between metric and imperial measurements\n- the ability to use contacts in your contacts list so that you don't need to type in their email everytime you want to send a listing\n- the ability to be able to search by building type: I don't want to have to scroll through a list of condos/townhomes/semi-detached homes if I am only look for detached homes.\n- the ability to keep some sort of history of homes that you have viewed\n \nI understand the app is new but I believe that there is plenty of room for improvement to make this app a great tool for house hunters.","I wish I could roll back this update, because now I can't search at all.","Worked fine until the update. Update added extra fields to the search option, but now it doesn't matter what search options you select, clicking \"search\" gives you an error message saying the request is invalid!  Please fix ASAP!","Could be good if only it would reload images after you look at a house. As it is now, you look at pictures of the inside of a house, and when you go back to your list again, the pictures are gone. This makes you have to do a search again. Poor quality program.","The phone freezes, not even one single search I could do.","Trash. This feels like someone in high-school was asked to build an app? So many functions were lost. The top banner is weirdly large, the pricing in the map is messy especially with less filter options to narrow down the search, once a home is selected the swipe up is sticky(and then again with a massive banner). Narrow my search? Okay sure but where do I select # of beds/baths? Waterfront? Why did the upgrade lose features. F on this high school project!","Who ever thought that changing the app to what it is now was a good idea? Can\u2019t even narrow down searches beyond the location on map. Terrible!","Not too impressed that I have lost all of my saved searches and favourites, especially while I'm doing market research before we make a house purchase. Was there no user testing of the new app before the release? Why would you update without keeping the important feature that includes users' saved data? Hope that gets brought back.","For some reason, they force full screen. The navigation bar, clock, etc... disappear. Along with that comes one gesture, when swiping back to the previous picture more than often, you will swipe completely out of the image slides. The app starts on listing instead of a map, which is silly. The search filters nowbtake an extra step to find. The Ui on the old app was so much better. I'll just use the website from now on. Maybe ask the app dev for your money back.","Other than the full screen issue that other people have mentioned, I've recently noticed that when you search for the name of an area, not all the postal codes relevant to that area are showing up in the search. This could definitely hinder the sale of a house if searchers are only using the app.","Brutally bad app. The original one released is by far better than this! Beyond freezing up all the time, it is very difficult to navigate, and is very limited in the search parameters one can choose. I suggest using the website instead.","Overall, it seems like this is a downgrade from the previous version. Couple things I don't like: - They got rid of saved searches. This needs to be added in as it made looking at locations easier. - The map view is too cluttered. It just shows all listings as their price, instead of a bubble showing total number of listings Atleast the menus are easy to navigate, and search functions don't take much time to figure out.","Downloaded the app and tried to search for properties...every search kept showing me the lake and no properties...","It's useless! You can't filter results! Who wants or needs to see every single listing?? And you can't save a search anymore? Why did you make a reasonably decent app so completely useless?","The functionality of the searches has improved, nice update","The app won't search locations. It worked yesterday and this morning I can't search any locations. I deleted and re-download the app and it still has the same issue","This was a good app but for the last few versions it has lost the ability to sort by price so every listing comes up and there land up being to many listings to have any sort of meaningful search.\nNow they also make you set up an account.\n\nThey should go back to Version 1","We like the flow, cleaner lines and less clutter approach. However, we miss being able to login and save searches etc. Also when our favourite listings were sold or no longer being listed you could temporarily see that they going to be removed.","APP: Too many duplicate listings... Takes away from focusing on listings really have internet in. Or finding \"the one\". WEBSITE: Printing listings is a waste of paper (7pages for a basic 1 page need) The fact that MLS \"exists\" gives the app a \"3 star rating\". One more thing: The map and search feature are \"too\" in sync. Having the option to search more than one \"town/city/location would be awesome. Zooming in should be more precise (I get listings that are NOT on my immed. screen)","I\u2019m not looking for a cookie cutter house, I\u2019m looking for a house with an oversized garage or large shop for many cars. I would like to search properties by square footage of garage and or barns.","All previous saved searches are erased if you reinstall.","Search filters don't work and currently setting a date to filter new listing will crash the app.","I don't like this new version. It is difficult to do filters, multiple searches, show new listings only and there isn't even a way to exit","1) the ability to hide listings I'm not interested in (even if they match search criteria)\n\nAnd\n\n2) the ability to filter out basement apartments. Or at least define which floors you want. I know this might be hard based on what info is input. But please consider it? Maybe a \"exclude listings with these keywords:\" feature.","Fixed a few issues, intruded a lot more. Being able to share listings by their URL is a nice touch, and saves having to search for the listing on your mobile site. But, I am unable to change the 'listings since __ date' as the app crashes whenever I adjust the range. Additionally, the map feature has become very hit or miss, and often causes the app the crash also. The design is nice, but the functionality is lacking with this version.","it's missing a lot of search details. example: garage only, detached house. Also need a refresh button. please update.","Why make a harder to use app with less search options? Edit: after the app creators feedback, I decided to give it another try. It's just as easy to use if not better than the earlier version, just takes a bit of getting used to as things have moved around a bit.","This app needs better search filters like the web version. Example land size. Why should I have to look through every house on a small city lot if I\u2019m looking for 2+ or 10+ acres....?","This recent update totally changed the whole app. \n\nIt is full of bugs! Everything I do has problems. I can't even search for houses in a specific city. I search for houses in one city and it gives me houses in another city. Please go back to the old app!\n\nMap feature has loads of bugs. You can save the default measurements between imperial and metric. Whoever designs this app should be fired!\n\nUpdate- \n\nThey fixed most of the bugs. But a lot of annoying bugs still exist that they seem to ignore because they are too lazy to get their app developers to redo it. The default measurements never save. The saved searches sometimes work. Still not so great app.","Its not very useful, the search engine doesn't pick up addresses or postal codes or areas","Constantly reloading.. After you look at one property, you must start search all over again including selecting filters..","Very handy, gives enough info and pics. It would be better if the search engine can be improved.","Keeps closing when I try to search with filters. So can't even narrow down the houses available to what I'm looking looking for. Fairly useless and time consuming if I can't do that. Prefer the old Realtor app layout and ease of use.","So disappointed with this new app. Search is not user friendly &amp; now I've lost all my favourites from the other app. Why wouldn't you just update the old app? Just tried to search for houses with a garage. Did they all just sell overnight?","Can't search for freehold. App hides bottom navigation buttons (back, home, etc.) for no reason which is extremely annoying.","I found myself frustrated trying to complete a search while all of the price, property type, or other property fields where blank in the selection process.\n\nOnly in the morning they started working and I realized they were hidden due to dark mode. Other than that a stellar app, please fix!","The current version keeps crashing all the time and it asks for useless things like my Facebook account and stuff. It should has less feature and allow us to search what we want quickly and bug free. The search also takes much more time than before. \n\nInstead of becoming better it becomes worse. How is that possible?","Can\u2019t search properly, or zoom in and out on my phone. Horrible update and not user friendly at all.","When choosing \u201cProperty Type\u201d and \u201cPrice Range\u201d for example, the scrolling options come up blank when you want to enter search information. I\u2019ve never had this problem before with this app. I\u2019m using iPhone X iOS  13.3.1","Now that the update has happened there is no option to login on the app. My favorites list is gone and saved search is gone.","Wow, used to be a great app. Now it is horrible. Won't let me search anywhere but where I am. I don't want to search here, I'm moving. I set up a search where I want, but it changes to where I am.","The old app worked well. Now there are no saved searches, a bizarre search interface that is time consuming and ineffective, and some weird freaky map interface that is cluttered and difficult to navigate. Yay, you broke your app! Well done.","Multiple basic features are gone with the new update, and the new app feels very bad at searching for properties which is terrible since that is its major purpose. \n\nList of things I noticed within 5 minutes of using the app:\n- cannot save multiple searches\n- cannot search only by new listings within last 7 days (Yes I know I can pick a date on the calendar but that is not the same as saying \u201clast 7 days\u201d)\n- can only see one listing picture/price on screen at a time (the horizontal scrolling here is terrible for usability)","All the search options are messed up.  All the drop menus are blank.  The key word option shuts down the app.  So frustrating.","I feel like the app went backwards with the recent update. I find the fields offer less customizability. Used to be able to search for a property between let's say 50-100 acres. Now can only only select a minimum size. I find the map harder to interact with and in general i find it very clunky trying to navigate between different fields. I'm generally not even using the app that much any more and have switched to other apps.","The app crashes regularly, does not display properly, cannot execute simple geographic searches.","I miss the map feature which showed dots with properties with your search requirements ... it allowed the ability to drag the map and search other areas for similar ptoperties .. provides a broader scope to view locations or properties nearby New app doesn't seem to provide for this","The latest update is a big disappointment. Not as intuitive, can\u2019t create combined for rent and for sale searches, difficult to create and filter multiple saved searches.  Basically was forced to stop using the app.","I used to be able to see listings for the BC Southern Interior and Vancouver Island but now they have all disappeared.  Why is there less listings available now?  I haven\u2019t changed my search parameters so it can\u2019t be that..,","Keeps crashing in the middle of a search. Frustrating to say the least. Grrrr","Just brutal... the search options are horrendous, and the map is now useless. It almost feels like they made it hard to use on purpose so you have to contact a buying realtor. Super disingenuous.","On my iPhone 8, it won\u2019t allow me to change the location when searching and filtering.  The default that was once saved keeps stubbornly reappearing in the search box even when I try to delete it and overwrite it.  This app has glitches like that that make it a pain to use.","I miss the old app where you could save searches.   This version is a pain to view on my phone, the map is awkward &amp; often unresponsive, &amp; the arrow is in a terrible place so it\u2019s easily hit by accident while moving the map &amp; places you back where ypu physically are.","Very basic parameters for filtering. Hard to send listings to others. Poor search options. Doesn\u2019t work as well on iPad. No way to have a search run daily and send notifications. \n\nCheck out Trulia, Redfin, Zillow or the host of others for what an app should look like. \n\nRealtors should take the value this App provides seriously as it\u2019s an extension of the service you provide.","When the app eventually lets you in without crashing, the app is frustrating to use. It does not let you search by map, always going to list mode. It constantly loses its mind and forgets my search criteria.  \n\nStay away for this app!!!","Well since half the of filtering options are gone the app is useless... thanks for that... guess I'll go back to using the website. Reply to response: yes and the \"full range of search options\" is not the full range it previously was.","Search criteria has been lowered. One big one was \"freehold\" and \"leasehold\" searches. I have to sift through condo's, mobile homes and townhome listings. Maybe add \"strata\" as a criteria for gated communities with freehold properties. Photos are another annoyance to compete with. You swipe back to see last pic and you swipe back to the listing information. Did they even use testers on this app that BUY property? Fire what ever company you hired for this app development. Idiots.....","What a horrible new layout, hard to navigate, hard to search for properties, terrible filters. Not only is the new app horrible, you can't even sign in, so saved searches and favorite properties are useless.","Great app, but wondering why the search function at $1 million jumps in increments of $500,000 instead of $100,000 like on the website?","Would like the search to rotate to landscape.","One bug fixed, 3 more come up. Now the scroll function does not display so I cannot set search parameters. Not compatible with iPads either. Such an awful app! Could be so amazing and functional.","Then I have to restart my search.  Pain in the neck.","I can't log into the app so my favorites and saves search do not transfer.","Crashes a lot and search near me function does nothing.","The feature for choosing the price range for housing has not worked in months!

I have deleted the app and refreshed, and also does not work on my husbands phone so I know it\u2019s not just me. Please fix ASAP!","Not a fully functioning app. Definitely recommend checking into the search function/narrowing results.","Why does land filter start with 0-10 acres? If I\u2019m looking for an acreage, I want to filter out city lots. Website has different options, app filter is just useless.","Terrible... new app is less intuitive, has fewer features, and new functions that actually makes searches more frustrating. What's with the ridiculous highlight feature that picks a particular map listing to default on? Did anyone ask for that? It's like they went out of their way to make a poor app. Hire a UI dev... or go back to the old app.","This app has gotten worse. Where did the advanced search go? I enjoyed having the setting to only search the most recent postings and now I can't. I really think the developer dropped the ball. I have a family of 5 and want a more spacious home, and there is no option to input the specifications we need to narrow the search down. The only option there is, is to look on a map and see the price of homes. Please fix it.","They updated the app and now the filter option texts are the same colour as the background. So I can\u2019t create filters for my search results. App needs some work","Overall I've found the new app much more difficult to navigate and find properties based on my search criteria. The old app was more user friendly in my opinion","Now can only search for residential, not acreage, agricultural, recreational, etc.  No keyword search.  This app has only been getting worse since it was introduced years ago and they refuse to update.  They really just want you to call a realtor.  Really need an alternative to this garbage the Canadian real estate board puts out.","Search fields that contain scroll wheels don\u2019t show the text, blank scroll wheel. For example min and max price.","This current version of the app does not work. \n1. It shuts down as soon as it opens.\n2. If it doesn't shut down as soon as it opens, it cashes about 30 seconds in. \n3. When typing in a location to search (sale or rental) it ignores your request and gives you options only in your current location you're in. So you need to type in a new area to search about 2-3 times before it will give you what it wants...but then just crashes anyways. \n4. If you're lucky enough to get far into your search, it doesn't like it when you zoom out to look at a broader area of the location you're looking in, so it constantly zooms in on neighborhood that you didn't ask for. \n\nThis app used to be very useful, and I am sure the techs will sort out the issues with it soon enough, but it's been like this since the beginning of May. \n\nGood luck!","Not as detailed as former app. Unable to save searches with different filters:(","Brutal update as stated numerous times by others.

I was referring to function to save 5 searches as favs, not the properties. This app absolutely sucks. It's not even worth one star. Nothing comparing to the old version. This one does not save or remember your previous search, doesn't allow to make favorites and map opens up in the middle of the ocean. Very dissatisfied","I'm going to loose my next house purchase because off this app. Search is horrible.. Hell with the App. Just Bookmark the website.","Everytime I search the price filter is blank so I have to guess what number I\u2019ve scrolled on. No updates waiting, tried uninstall and reinstall and still does work.. fix your garbage app","If I search and then further refine my search, touch anything like sort differently, etc., It will often reset some of my search parameters or change my map so that I have to redo part of the search. It's clunky and time consuming in this way. It's also extremely annoying that I can't set a general assumption for amortization and rate and see a quick approximate payment. I have to back out of my search and be taken to a browser window.","Even when it doesn't crash it is still not working. My saved searches don't show me the correct neighbourhood and whenever I try to move around the map it keeps flipping back to the list page. Very frustrating.","I have been experiencing a \u201cglitch\u201d. When I try to change my map search from residential to vacant land or recreational and so on, no options appear but I\u2019m able to blindly tap until I\u2019ve stumbled across what option I want.","New app is slow, buggy, and has reduced functionality. One example: If I search for houses with a garage, then almost none of the results actually have a garage. Also, they removed the ability to save multiple searches.","All the scroll wheels to fine tune a property search are now blank. I get haptic feedback so just scroll the blank white area hoping i land on the right number, and blindly fine tune it. App only works when not in dark mode.\nAlso keeps crashing when i try to add keywords to the search.","A search field where you can search by home building date would be a nice add. Some of us look for particular decades/eras of house design.","This \"upgrade\" was the worst move! No street names can be seen on the search map. I used to go on daily to check out listings until you changed it. Now I don't go on at all!","Trying to use this app is painful, had to delete it.  Not only does it keep crashing but saved searches keep randomly ignoring the saved location so I was always having to start new searches in between crashes","The app constantly crashes on iOS. \nwwwDot isn\u2019t much better. Searching an \u201carea\u201d is pointless because the app will search the area you have zoomed out to regardless.","after taking time to spend learning this app I still do not like it. It seems to crash when I put a date when to search for new listings. The map is super confusing. I liked the plain map that wasn't a huge distraction.","When I try to personalize the search, the drop down tab is blank. I have to pretend to scroll on it to select certain things like \u201chouse, vacation lot, semi-detached, detached, etc\u201d. If I could post a picture to explain this better I would. But basically it needs to be fixed so you can see the drop down menus.","The fixes destroyed a good app completely and the search engine doesn\u2019t even have freehold search option online now it\u2019s impossible to find properties now","Cannot login, cannot view favorites. Limited search functionality. Why force us to use this app when it's not done? Add all the features of the old app before you shove it down our throats. The old app constantly comes up saying \"this app not supported, update now\"","This app always closes on you, doesn't save search entry correctly, and is addicted to zooming in when you don't ask it to. Whatever was changed in last update, please undo it! It's not worth the headache","Not a fan of the new one. I don't like when you actually tap the map all the prices show up and it suddenly becomes a cluttered disaster. The map also groups a ton of houses together, by clicking one house it will expand the search area for you and show houses from a wider geographic range. The map is a disaster, but the search interface is much tidier and easier to navigate.","I expect the same response from the developers that all other reviews recieved but here goes. Favorite searches cannot be saved requiring a new search to be set up every time. Very frustrating. At least the old ap is still up so I continue my house search with that one.","Awful. I put in the parameters of what I'm looking for, and it says that there are no listings that match my query. But when I remove all filters, I find tons that met my exact search. I've even tried typing in the MLS number, and the property won't show up. Uninstalled this app as it was useless.","I have saved few search categories but every time I click on those it confuses the location with other location\u2019s filters.","Search function doesn\u2019t work leaves characters off at the beginning or adds characters you didn\u2019t enter.\nPoorly designed, thought out and implemented.  Go back and get a new APP designer. Preferably one who has used APPs before.","Asks me to share my location every time app is started. I don't want to. Stop. Asking. app clears the text field when attempting to edit a previous search. Very annoying. Let me adjust the previous search.","Can\u2019t see any search features","Still can't search by multiple building/property types.","Can't easily search recently listed. The app is harder to use than before.","Needs some more development. It deleted all my favourite in the update and removed the waterfront option in the search criteria.","Worse than last one, doesn't search based on keywords.","Horrible app... crashes , poor search ability ...very disappointing \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude44 why even launch this if it's not ready... cant search properties without land showing up... tried filtering out says no listings... yet map view shows everything... have to look at all the land listings that I'm not interested in","None of the drop down filters populate with any info. Making the search useless.","Search with key words is my favourite feature.  Example is must sell, motivated buyer","This app used to be okay, but there are tons of bugs now. When I type in the town I want to search in, I tap the correct one that pops up, but then it reverts back to the city I\u2019m currently in. When I try to adjust the max price, number of bedrooms etc, the list that pops up is blank. I can select things, but I can\u2019t see them. I\u2019ve tried on my iPhone and iPad, and it\u2019s the same issues on both. Please fix!!","While visually appealing the release of this app was premature and half-baked, and should be marked as a beta test release. Why would I want to use it when I can't port over saves and searches from a desktop. This is useless at this point. Whoever figured that this should be released eith out the full slate of searches of the old app should have to face the consequences of such a terrible release","This is a typical example of how to mess up something that worked perfectly, always crashes and the search options are horrible, super fail","It's completely useless to me! I can't do the searches I need to do or get the info I want. I'll keep using the old app.","Did they change developers and get forced to start over?\n\nYou used to be able to open the app, centre it quickly on you location and zoom in, in like 1 or 2 taps after opening the application. \n\nNow the map / search is clumsy to filter.","Like I think it looks nicer but my biggest issue with the new app is that you can't search by ownership/title. Everything else is there but not that... How come? Can I have it back please?","Never seen a app that crashes so many times..can't even search a property and it crashes...developers should not be in business..what a waste of time","Very disappointed in this new release. Some of the functions have been removed such as \"saved searches\" (unless I haven't found that function). I found the previous version very good, guess in the world of apps if you don't update enough people aren't happy. In this case, not a positive experience for me.","1 - can\u2019t actually get it to search the city I want it keeps overriding back to my local area\n2 - I can\u2019t see any of the filter values.","Crashes within 30 s of opening app and doesn't seem to register my location as each time I search it jumps to middle of nowhere Manitoba. Very frustrating this far.","Hi, your app is facing some bugs on iOS. Specifically, when I attempt to change the search criteria all of the fields show up blank. I don\u2019t know which selections are there. Please correct.","The old app was more clear to set filters or narrow searches. Would not recommend this to others. My experience with this app has turned sour.","This new app is definitely not like the previous app. Older app was easier to use the options of homes you want to search out. Older app had a beautiful layout of the map systems. I will find another source of searching homes/property. I am very disappointed .","You took away the ability to save an area as a search. Try using THAT on a rural area...or a city area for that matter. \n\nYou removed all of my saved searches. \n\nYour \"feedback\" tries to load a survey. \n\nThis is a total, utter, piece of crap!\n\nNice going. Didn't think you could make the app worse, but some idiot managed to approve this. How?","New app doesn't let you filter out Condo/Strata listings from Freehold listing like in previous app. Such a shame, as now my search isn't populating what I'm looking for.","Missing basic features like multiple saved searches, and the ability to get notifications when new homes appear that match your criteria.","Search bar frequently resets while you're typing. Crashes frequently.","I don't even know how my app updated to the newer version but it is terrible compared to the last version. I can't get the app to search in my city or save a search (it defaults to the middle of nowhere in Manitoba?), I constantly have to zoom out then back and scroll over to where I entered to search. It takes forever to load or search items, crashes, and is an overall flop. The only positive is you can narrow your search based on bedrooms, bathrooms and such now but what good is that if you can't search?\nUPDATE: I have since uninstalled this app and had two updates and it is even worse!!! I can't even open the app now? If I were realtor.ca I would fire whoever put this together. I've never experienced an app this terrible before!","Brutal update. No login, no saved searches, no listing update alerts. Dark mode map with no option for light mode. Just made the app useless for me. Update to response from developer. I don't want satellite view, I want a light mode on the map. Use case: the lack of contrast makes the map very hard to read. I don't want to just save listings in the app, I want the saved listing from my account via the website to appear in my app. Use case is that I search on my PC, save listing. Log into my phone and add listings to a directions map. Removing this \"sync\" feature removes one of the most useful functions.","I never had a problem with this app until the last update. I gave myself a few weeks to adjust to it, but I\u2019ll I\u2019ve learned is that it\u2019s not user friendly and prohibits my ability to use the app.\nSomeone thought it\u2019d be cool or original to copy the format of the American realtor app. But their version is significantly better, easier to use and has a lot more features that make the format work that this one just doesn\u2019t have. Such as the \u201cviewed\u201d check mark for a house you s already looked at. The closest thing to a list feature is the other homes in your search area. Which seems to have no rhyme or reason for their order nor the ability to change the sort. \u201cCost, newest\u201d\nYou also can\u2019t scroll through any information on the property unless you go to it\u2019s page. At which point returning resets your search \u201clist\u201d. And sometimes even completely refreshes and clears your search filters. \nHorrible design. Really. Whoever made this, should be embarrassed. For now I find myself just going to be webpage in my browser because the site is far superior to the app.","New app looks great, I know it\u2019s new and something to get used to. Option for search filters is still missing the basics.","You make all the money in world and still can't make a user friendly app with easy to look navigate on the map and search on the property.","It keeps crashing every time I start typing a keyword in the filters! Another annoying problem with the filtered searches is that the scroll-down options for everything (home type, price, # of bedrooms, etc.) are blank! I blind-scroll until I get the result I need. Please fix this! It\u2019s been a few months and I can only use my computer and for searching.","New look is welcome, however will crash without warning, and close the app. Needs a patch to fix the issues, on an otherwise great search platform.","Whenever I click on a saved search it only looks for properties in my current location I\u2019m at? Useless!","Very difficult to search in specific area","Ever since they updated the app everything isn't as easy to use.\nWhen it doesn't crash every 5 seconds, the map likes to realign itself so if you zoom in/out of an area it recentres itself unnecessarily.\nWhen filtering you search it now has bathrooms before bedrooms and I keep filtering the wrong way (3batrooms 2 bed).\nWho designed this 'updated' version in so many ways it seems like a complete down grade.","Search parameters are buggy. No price data or property histories. Useless without a realtor. Reinforced market opacity isn\u2019t good for anyone.","When you want to apply filters to your search, you will be asked to select, whether it\u2019s a detached, townhouse or apartment etc., however there is a bug that is not displaying any entries for a user to pick from.","Too simple. There is not enough flexibility in the searches.","Crashes when you try and search by date....bring back the old app...no upgrades as far as I can tell","If you're looking to waste time and be annoyed, this app is for you!! The new version of this app is horrendous. Zero functionality. Why even bother? No search functions. No filters. No list. I use the website now and am uninstalling this garbage because it is so bad. I hate it so much that I was compelled to review it, which I don't usually care about. Gone back to using the website, at least there are some filters and a list option. I would give a 0 if I could.","The information on real estate listings is fairly comprehensive but the ability so save searches is gone. Each time you open the app you have to start all over again. You use to be able to save 5 areas of interest, click on them and immediately seen what\u2019s new. Now it takes forever. Bring back the old app.... please.","Screen size not compatible, search saving not efficient.","The app has become impossible to work with. Constantly jumping out of searches back to home base. Now it keeps crashing and closing. Time for a new app designer","Why remove saved searches function? Who thought it was a good idea to have JUST ONE default search option and not be able to have other searches saved?!?! It might have been a good idea to have some beta testers before releasing this app and making the old one obsolete!","This used to be a very good app but it now has lost so many required filters and features that it has become redundant.  For instance, it\u2019s no longer possible to search for anything other than a house. Want to buy vacant land or a building lot?  You\u2019re out of luck. Agricultural property?  No way!\n\nIt\u2019s time to bring back the filters and features that made this app so popular.","This new format is terrible and wiped out my saved searches. Why would you do that? I\u2019m getting ready to just remove it and strictly use Zolo.  I hate how it zooms in as soon as you click on one area. The old format never did that.","Just updated the app it still crashes mid search :(. At least it isn't crashing on start anymore...","None of the drop down menus work on iPhones or iPads when trying to narrow searches. They open up and remain blank so you can\u2019t see what you\u2019re selecting.","The search functions on the app are not as intuitive as the full website and the drop down for organizing your search shows nothing. You can hear the clicks as something is picked, but you have no idea what it is.\nI actually set up saved searches through the website so all I have to do is look on my phone and not have to try and do too much with this app.","Old app was far better I am uninstalling this it sucks I do not even know how to use the map it just shows me properties near my location was no way that I can tell to search other areas","The search feature is less functional than the previous version and the scrolling through properties is onl left to right so slow and clunky. Clearly by others comments this was a fail for your UX team.","The share feature should be upgraded to be similar to Centris.ca., one should be able to airdrop the listing. The other feature that needs to be added is the ability to search for a property built before a certain year. \n\nOtherwise great app! Easy to store favourites and searches.","Can't do anything on this app. Looking for a house to purchase right now but I guess my searchs won't be happening in the area I'm in. Thanks Obama I mean thanks Relators you can't do much right other then take my money when you need it.","Is this new version a joke? Missing major features, and it seems like no one even tried the filtering. You can't save multiple searches? You can't log in? Wth? The developers should feel shame for thinking this is ANYWHERE near ready for release. Whoever 'convinced' them it was, as well as whomever ok'd it, should be out looking for new jobs in a different field. Holy moly!","Old app was way better. Why is map only half the screen and all dark blue? The map hurts my eyes, why should app be different then website. This is a rip off of Royal LePage and other companies website maps and search, it's an awful design not sure why you would change to that!","No login to be able to save your favorites to your account and sync them with the desktop site.\n\nParameters of search are not always consistent.","I didn't think it could get worse!! The search on the app is terrible! Pretty much anything you want to do takes you to the website on the internet so why bother installing an app?! I find this app SOOOOO difficult to use that it actually makes me want to not bother house hunting as it makes it so frustrating!!!","You destroyed the best property search tool. This app is so full of bugs and can't do the detailed searches the previous app could do. Completely useless. Where are my saved searches? I am listing my property in the next mo th. What a setback this is in a property search. If you slightly miss an option in selecting search criteria everything you selected is lots. Howcan you release an app where you can't import your previously saved properties and searches. Your QA team should be fired,","I'm a UI/UX designer but you don't need to be to see how bad this new version of this app is. At the moment I can't even open the app without it crashing instantly. There are so many other bugs also. \n\nI would appreciate it if you reverted back to the old app until you've fixed the awful UX and bugs. \n\nBugs:\nI hate when I zoom the map to an appropriate area that I want to view  and as the pins load in it auto zooms in to the pins that load in. \n\nThe time it takes for loading in results when you tap a pin is too long. \n\nThe women in the photo when the app launches look like twins and it's creepy. \n\nWhen I start a new search in a new city it often flickers back to the old city I was searching in or my current location. \n\nWhen I set a search to residential/house and I try to select \"detached\" the dropdown closes and selects attached. It becomes stuck on this and doesn't let you select anything else. \n\nWhen I adjust the slider to \"buy\" instead of buy/rent I expect it to work if I just tap \"buy\" but instead need to actually slide the slider (should work both ways) \n\nSo many other things that I can't think of.

How do I do this?","Better than the previous one but I don't see an option to log in and see my save search and listing. Am I missing something","The app is a disappointment. The old app allowed you to sign in and have your favorites and realtors update so you could also browse on the computer too. This app is also clunky and hard to use. The map is not friendly.

This one is super disorganized, they made something that worked so well and replaced it with this. can't even search freehold vs condo, and the app keeps on crashing whenever I try and search by newly listed. Guess I am going to have to use redfin to search for houses until this app starts working properly like the old one did.","The old app worked so much better.

The search feature is hard to navigate and terribly inaccurate. I've tried to type exact addresses in of houses I know are for sale, and it doesn't find them.","The new update only shows search results by listing individually as opposed to showing a list with a photo, price, and unit details for a building.

It force closes any time I want to add a key word in the search (the website seems to be lacking the feature all together).

Seriously do you not UAT any of this before you do a release?!? This release is even worse than the last one!  You broke the ability to snap to your location on the map, now I have to finger zoom to get there and the save search functionality does NOT work despite putting in a function to do so now. I so miss the days when I had up to five different saved searches going. At least you added a new lighter coloured base map to choose from instead of being stuck with that awful dark version where the legal lot lines are completely un-viewable.  I\u2019m also hearing complaints from real estate agents about this app so it\u2019s not just property seekers.

The map is a joke and the search doesn't find listings that you can easily find in the iPad or desktop version...","This has to be one of the worst apps. It works fun if you are searching for real estate exactly where you are both otherwise none of the search functions work - not the filters, can\u2019t look up a specific MLS number, nothing - the search just reverts back to your current location. Horrific app and developers should be fired.","Select location, keep all search preferences to \u201cAny\u201d and get \u201cno listings available\u201d no matter where I search. \n\nOn top of that, app is incredibly unorganized compared to website and other realtor apps.","I\u2019m not sure what happened but the new UI refresh makes it even harder to search for properties.

Now this app is broken and useless if you want to narrow your search and you\u2019re stuck with having to look through every individual property to see if it\u2019s what you want.","The search is very rudimentary. \n\nThese are the important filters:\nArea (not of the land)\nAge of buildings building\nFloor number\nType of stove\nType of flooring\nView (as a filter not keyword)\nNumber of parking spots\nStorage\nAC (as a filter not a keyword)\nType of heating","Unfortunately this app is not very good. Sharing is limited to email, defaults to somewhere near west Africa or Winnipeg, always wants my location even when I\u2019m not looking for real estate in my location. Not easy to go between website and app. Search doesn\u2019t work. The list goes on. This app should be much better.","I want to do basic search of city and sort by listing date but indicates no listings available in my region (there are-its a city) and when I finally get listings to appear, I\u2019m not able to sort new to old, only by price. Needs many modifications.","Difficult to use, map area disappears so you have to search again. Loved the old app, used it daily since we are looking for a new home. Gave this one a few weeks but will be uninstalling since it frustrates rather than helps.","This app is barely usable, as it crashes repeatedly, and isn't user friendly.  Further, searches don't save as expected and the app often doesn't even open.","Award for most broken search engine ever.","Could not be more useless.  Search around for other local real estate apps...this one CRASHES IMMEDIATELY.  This is nothing new though!  This has been happening for MONTHS.  The developers and MLS/Realtor.ca do not care.","Removed saved searches so houses are harder to find. Navigation bar auto-hides and app forces full screen, against my preferences. It's faster and less usable than the previous app. If they didn't have to have every listing, I wouldn't use this app.","Recent update has made harder to use. Can\u2019t find signin, saved searches, or favourites anymore.","You changed the app and now All the favourites I have been saving are gone? And I can sign in? What\u2019s going on? Do I have to go through a week of searches all over again??","Can\u2019t save any search criteria. So you have to re-enter all the filter criteria every time. So frustrating!\nWhy do you have to go to the website to login? Why not contain everything within the app???  Who uses desktop for this type of app??? And even if they do, synch it in the background, like almost every other app.  You don\u2019t use the Amazon app and then have to go to a website to enter your login info!!! What were they thinking ????","At first you can search but when you zoom in on something there\u2019s no going back after that. Haven\u2019t been impressed since it updated. Very disappointed.","When I\u2019m in \u201cNew Listing\u201d and I\u2019m changing the date, or any of the search options, everything is blank. I have to guess approximately where I want it, choose Done, then I see where I landed on. Not a fan of this latest update. Also wish there is an option to filter by sqft.","Roll back the version - the new versions sucks not user friendly, crashes all the times.  Just SUCKS!    UX/UI is horrible.","Old app was amazing, used it everyday. This version is horrible and unusable. It's been a few months and I still stand by the fact that whoever designed the new app should be fired.","Bring back the old version. The new \"realtor\" app is horrible. It crashes and quits over and over, the map is glitchy and doesn't let you \"explore\", it isn't convenient to use at all. I can truly say this update is painful to use.","What ever happened to \" the customer is always right\"? It seems that everyone preferred the interface and usability of the old app as opposed to this new one. Navigating through the listing is terrible compared to the older version. I honestly can't stand this app now. My best advice without sounding too rude would be please change the interface to the old version. It worked so seamlessly. This was definitely a downgrade, not an upgrade.","New app sucks the old app was perfect had no reason to change","Please return to the old app \ud83d\ude4f very bad update","Thankfully we can still use the old app for now.","Bring back old version; it actually worked.  This new version I) Crashes every time I use it ii) The recent listings function is broken so there is no way to view only new listings, have to view them all iii) there is no user account login/profile anymore, so cannot use the app across multiple platforms and all data is lost during system upgrades or switching devices.  Unsure how a company with so much financial backing can have such a horrible broken app.  Hire a new app development team!","This new update is not user friendly. The old version is a lot easier to navigate.","I hate the new update it\u2019s not as easy to go through everything as it was before. Please change it back","Bring back the old App! The interface is slow and why does it always zoom in on a collection of properties? Terrible. If I could rate it 0/5 I would.","Change it back to how it was before, i don't get why there needed to be a change to the format in the first place. I really don't like this new update, I find its way less organized and uncomfortable to use. Needs to go back to how it was before!","App crashes when trying to filter by date. Overall, this app is slow and not very user friendly. Wish they kept the old one and improved on that rather than releasing a new one from scratch.","New version is terrible! \nThe old version was great! I used it very often and now I won\u2019t anymore. Will have to find another one! \nWhy is it dark? Very annoying. Reacts slow too. Hard to navigate!! Bring back the older version please!","The old app is much better, this new one is horrible bring back the old one","I hate the new app. The old app worked just fine. Why change it?","The old app was glitchy, but this new version takes the cake. Agh! Map view virtually inaccessible, view bounces all over. Searching is glitchy, crashes twice. Update: new version even worse, crashes seconds into launch.","I've never left a comment for any app before. But this needs one. The old version was a lot easier to navigate.","I miss the old version.  This version with the new look and improvements are pretty bad.  Can no longer view homes without the app shutting down and crashing.  The map isn\u2019t easy to navigate like before.  Please revert back to the older version.","Terrible app, I miss the old one. Just go straight to the website until this hot garbage is replaced or rolled back.","Absolutely terrible app, everything has become more difficult and the new search tab is super annoying. Realtor should got back to the old app","Could you please make it to go back to the previous version? The new version is horrifying. All the good functions from the previous versions are gone.\n\nThe current version is ridiculously hard to use. Very user unfriendly. This is a disaster.\n\nIt feels like it was Zolo\u2019s team made the decision to update this app to this disastrous version so that customer could delete this App and go to the competitors.","If you can keep the pre-March 2021 version, do it.  The new version is no user friendly.   \nIt has less search options and difficult or impossible to navigate new listings by map.","Used to be a 5 star app, would give 0 stars after the update. Updates are usually welcome, not this one, map in previous version was very user friendly and simple, new version is hard to use. Switch it back!","The new app is awful. It's hard to use. Pictures take forever to load. I miss being able to search with the map, and being able narrow down the specific locations I was interested in. It is not at all user friendly. Bring back the old app!","Please go back to the previous app. It was much easier to use.","Can we go back to the old app?","Horrible give us back the old one can't sign in and get my favorites back doesn't give half the options old one did am deleting and going to find something else","Crashes continually! Bring back the old App and fire the programmers! This is unusable!","The last app had its short comings but worked great.\nDid this upgrade recently and wish I could go back! \nThis version is so buggy it's almost useless","When will you bring back the old app? Your rating has tanked since the upgrade. Nobody likes the app. Big mistake. Why \"fix\" what wasnt broken? So annoying that when flipping through photos, it very easily backs right out of the listing. So infuriating!!","Horrible interface, go back to the older version. Not user friendly at all! Will not ever use this again.","Awful and hard to navigate! Cannot search the new from old and it is just slow and buggy. Please go back to the old one!","Wow. Everyone is right, its garbage. There was nothing wrong with the old version. This one is unusable.","Too many problems with this app. Go back to the old version.","Terrible. Always crashes, annoying to use, go back to the old app it was much easier to use.","The new app sucks.","Do not delete the old app! It still works and I think it shows listing. This app is garbage. Browsing the map is slower and choppier. When you zoom out, and tap on a house, it zooms it right back in. No idea why they made a new app.","I like old app.better","I\u2019ve been using this app for years which was fantastic and the newest version of 4.0 is horrible. Not user friendly at all. How do I uninstall and install the previous version?","Now crashes EVERY time. Bring back the old version till you fix this.\nHow not to upgrade software.... It's wiped out my 3 standard searches after upgrade. Useless. Of course it wants to harvest my email and details in the future. Annoyed....","I miss the old app. The new one may look pretty but that's about it. I want an easy to use app that I can search properties, not this. The map is terrible, seeing a cluster of properties and having to zoom it to see one at a time is very annoying. Swing and a miss realtor. Based on reviews I would suggest going back to old app.","Did a 3 year old make this app?","Terrible new version, i wonder who's idea that was? How can you mess up so much? Bring back the old app.","Not very user friendly. Miss the old app.","Please just bring back the old app. It was amazing. The new update is awful!!","The update is awful. Interface is not user friendly or intuitive.

This is ridiculous.","Unable to save searches and very hard to navigate. Please bring back precious version.","Old app was good, not great. But this new version makes the old app look like a masterpiece. I wish I didn't update!","Not one single person enjoys the new version, yet still not reverting back lol","The latest update has taken everything\nI loved about this app and ruined it. Crashes all the time and then when/if it does work; it is choppy, slow and still crashes. Pictures are terrible now too and contorted into odd sized  and stretched versions. This needs to be fixed....go back to the old version please.","Hate the new app!! Not user friendly","New version for iPhone X please\nBlair","This new app is much clunkier amd more difficult to use than the previous version. Theres no list, just a carousel. You cant see nearly as much info without actually clicking in the listing. Its much more difficult to use the very cluttered map. Boo. Bring back the old version.","The new app is not user friendly... very annoying","Please please I'm begging one fire whoever convinced you that this new version was an improvement and give us back the old version. Thx","This app is NOT user friendly and I hate the layout on opening the app.   You MUST RESTORE the old app or at least make it available to download.

I hope you guys bring back the old one.","Preferred the old app !","The latest version is a frustrating user experience.  Please revert to previous version which worked brilliantly.","Dislike the new app. Bring back old map format","Absolutely terrible. You took a perfectly good app and destroyed it.

I hope the developers will revert to the previous version functionality.","Not a fan of the new update. Should have just made the old version better for iPads.

Bring back the previous platform","I don\u2019t like the new version of this app, is there anyway to get back to the old version?

It is difficult to navigate and will crash every time for no reason.","New update is much harder to use than it was before.

New version is terrible, bring back old version PLEASE","Everything about this new app is a downgrade over the old one.

This one keeps on crashing \ud83d\ude2b","Horrible. Return Old app","Garbage App... The old version was 100x better and actually functioned on my iPad. This new version is like stepping back to the birth of the internet, so crap!","Here's an idea - test your updates before you launch them. I used to use this app all the time in it's old format. Not only does it crash within a few seconds of launch, but your new layout is difficult to use. The best part of your old format was the mapping. I could drive around and use the GPS to find details of a house I passed. Now I have to have an account for it to remember settings - if it even lasts long enough without crashing. Go back to your old format and fire the idiot who thought this was a good idea.","The old app was excellent... I don't know what they were thinking with this new app.","The previous version was far superior, don\u2019t wast your time with this version","Horrible. Huge downgrade from previous versions","Not good at all, it was easy and simple the old way. Now it's just challenging to get around the app. You can only save one search location. When I tried to change the date on when new houses are added, the app closes on me. Had to reinstall. Just terrible. I like to see the map of the neighborhoods and zoom in on the houses in that area, not a list of them. Sorry but please put old app back on. PLEASE!","New app is absolutely junk.

Probably should just cancel this version and go back to the old one please.","Terrible app. Old version worked quite well but this update is horrible. Cringe every time I use it.

Also cannot save searches anymore. \nUser interface was better on previous version!!\nPlease change it back.","The old one was nice and easy to understand this new app is garbage","Start putting vacant land in the section it actually belongs in.

Bring back the original app please.","Well, I thought I would give this app another try after the update and bug fixes. It's still terrible. Tells me no listings found when i put in pertinent info for my search! Not as user friendly as previous version. I have read many of the reviews and agree, time to scrap this new version.

Used the prior version for many years. This version is such a disappointment. Wish I had the choice to keep using the old one.","Horrible new interface for the app. Prefer the old version way more!!! Not even useable since they revamped the way it works.","New version is awful. This used to be my go to app for looking for properties but it's horrible. The map colours (dark) are the worst. There were a few suggestions I had with the old app in terms of filtering but overall it was easy to use. Please go back to the old version. I might just uninstall it if you don't.","Please give us back the old version. This new one is so painful to use...","New update for realtor app is overall worst please change it back to previous version or make it similar to previous one","My son will program this way better!\nNot working at all, please kill this version and either release a new version or roll back to the old version!!","It\u2019s useless app after the recent update. I have no choice but to use mobile version of realtor.ca. Please bring back the old app.","Unfinished downgrade. Delete this and just go back to the old one","Bring back the old app please. I will be looking for a different app to use in the meantime. Very disappointed.","The new version is really bad. The old version continues to ask me to download the newer poor performing version. Today the app update automatically updated creating two versions of the app on my mobile. As a result my pixel phone has been in an infinite restarting loop. Very disappointed, this version needs to be removed from the play store to avoid the risk of damaging people's hardware.","Do not like the new app. Not user friendly. I have been using the app from my realtor and the web based version of this. Miss the old version \ud83d\ude14","Please bring back the previous version...did anyone actually test this newest version before going live? I've uninstalled the app altogether, not worth the frustration.","Terrible. Plain and simple. The previous app was outstanding. This one the map is stuck in \"night mode\" and the putting price locations in the map was a horrible idea. They overlap each other which makes it very difficult to navigate and focus on properties. Bring back the previous app...I've deleted the new one. Refuse to use. UPDATE: yes I would have gone to the GLOBE but it wasn't there like it is now. Still a garbage app. Like I said I deleted it and won't use it. End of story.","Very bad UX... Not very responsive. Was any testing done before releasing this new version? Please return to the old app.","Old fashioned","Not user friendly! The older version was a lot more user friendly, easier to navigate.","Please look at housesigma and design a similar UI. Or at the very least please make the old version available again.","HATE the new version.  Please make it so you can turn off the zoom, every time I move the map and zoom it out it zooms back in....that is, if I can ever get the app to open....crash, crash crash!!!!   Ipad version so much better, please don't ruin it too!","This new app crashes when you try to search a property. The old version did not crash. Bring back the old app please. This one is useless.","Love the app but the newest version sucks. The previous one was better. They need to bring that lay out back!","Save yourselves a load of frustration and don\u2019t bother trying to use this version, don\u2019t \u2018upgrade\u2019 if you can avoid it. When they bring back the old style I will use it again. I suggest the developers heed the latest reviews and return to the previous version. This one is slow, cumbersome and confusing. It is horrible to navigate. Why did you change something that worked?","Randomly shuts down/closes all the time. Much preferred the old version, as it was user friendly.","Can't even open the app. Previous version was much faster and reliable. Please go back to old version!!!!!!!","Why fix something if it wasn't broken? This new app is terrible. I read the reviews and tried to give it a chance but they have literally ruined every single feature there was in the previous app. Filtering is now useless and now instead of scrolling up and down the search results, you're forced to scroll left and right as if this is a dating app. This is the most silly update I have had to deal with in a long time. Please bring back the old layout and features.","UI is horrible now, why change something that wasnt broken. Wish i could get the old version back. Time to find a new app","Only app I have ever used where the old version was substantially superior to the new one. What is going on here? Was this app coded by a potato?","Please bring back the last version of this app, it is completely useless to me now.  I used this app everyday before the update and I may have to delete it now. Very disappointing.","This new version of this realtor app isn't worth the time it took to create. Go back to the original app","I can\u2019t find your app in my new huawei phone. I have to switch back to my old iPhone. Sucks","New version is too slow, I preferred the older version.","The new version of this app is horrible. It is not user friendly, at all. It crashes all the time and is difficult to navigate.","The older version was better than this updated version. You zoom in and the app zooms in more. You zoom out and the app zooms back in. The pictures of properties are all distorted too. Why can't you just come up with an app that works?","easier than the old version","New app not close to being ready. Interface is glitchy and not intuitive, map doesn't navigate well. Going back resets everything.. I would suggest you go back to the old app until this is ready. Also was this not beta tested? ***Update June 12 2021. The app is actually worse now. The map continuously zooms into the area where the listing is, but the house doesn't show unless you slide the window back up. Sliding window also not responsive. Was a great app, should revert back. Awful app now!","Revert to the old version.","Please go back to your old format!","Bring back the old app. This one is terrible, not one thing I like about it. Have to stick to the desktop version until there is a better update.","Miss the old app","The user experience was a lot simpler and easier to use, but I just updated the app in March 2021 and it\u2019s so hard to use the app and so much more difficult than it used to be. \n\nPlease switch the app back to what it used to be, this version is too hard to use on mobile.","This new version will not load on my Samsung Note 9. The old app was way better....well at least I could use it! Now I have to find a desktop computer to view listings.","The old app was perfectly fine, except for the terrible sharing option that forced email only... I can\u2019t believe they got rid of the biggest component of the app- the ability to save your listings across multiple platforms. The search functionality is also not nearly as intuitive as the old version... just roll back to the old version and open up the sharing capabilities PLEASE!","Horrible navgiation compared to the older version. I stopped using this app because of this. Bring back the older version.","Go back to the old app!!!!!","Bring back the old version","Used to browse old app on a regular basis. New map is difficult to navigate. Definitely a downgraded app experience. Please go back to the to old app as soon as you can","I don't like the dark map. Bring back the old version","Please turn the ability to see estimated monthly payment back to this application. In a previous versions this feature was so convinient. Hope in nex improvement it will be back","New version ruined the app. Too hard to navigate.","Sucks compared to the old app. Also, scrolling side ways through listings is dumb and inconvenient, should be down/up .. natural thumb motion. So much more can be said, just please change back to old app.","I used to use this app on a daily basis and it helped me find my last rental, but the most recent update is trash and makes the app a lot less user friendly. Bring back the old program, it was a million times better and easier to use !","Bring it back","This app never had any issues before the new updates became available. I think they should just go back to the old version -that actually worked without closing every 5 seconds. Mine got to the point where I had to delete and reinstall and it still doesn't even load properly. This is awful and no longer a convenient app to use. I'd rather just open it in the web version.","Don\u2019t like the new version. Wish I could go back to the previous version. I\u2019m looking for a new way to search for properties. This one is much too frustrating. The black screen is horrible and the moment you click on a property it zooms in and you have to start all over again zooming out to look at the area you\u2019re interested in. The previous version was bright and colourful and very easy to use. I understand you updated to fix certain things but you could have fixed the bugs but left everything else the same. I\u2019m looking at all the other reviews if this new update and non of them seem favourable. Might be a sign that you should listen to what people want.","It constantly glitches on me. The update/newer version is not the best or user friendly. My parents who used the old app fine, cannot use this one at all.","Hard to use! Not user friendly! Please bring back the old app, this new version is terrible","Lots bugs , I am still using the old version.","This new version seems to be universally hated so I'm not sure why you haven't just gone back to the original. The fact that you discontinued that one is also infuriating. This new version is horribly clunky, hard to leave and move around the app, STILL can't login. I could go on but there's not enough space here. Go back to the old version until you fix this one.","The old version was WAY better. I really don\u2019t like the new version.\n\n**If there is anything we can do to fix.\n\nAgain go back to the old version. New version is non user friendly. Stop the new update it totally SUCKS.","Terrible....I'm starting a petition! BRING BACK THE OLD VERSION","App looks nice but crashes multiple times. Search feature is very hard to use. Has potential but major bugs right now. Wish I could go back to the old version.","The updated app is horrible. It is more difficult to use and not user friendly. The update cleared all my favourites. Bring back the old version.","Wow. So bad. Turn the old app back on.","Used to be good and run smooth minus some minor flaws.  Now they updated it and it is slow and annoying.  Can I go back to the old version ?","New version is awkward and laggy... old version works great. what happened...wish I could downgrade.","This new app is garbage. Bring back the old app layout, it was a lot better to use and easier to find properties. Also it is not updating with proper information.","This new version of the app is terrible! There is no way to set search parameters! Just shows all current listing and that's it! Not user friendly at all, yes the old app had a few glitches but why create a new app that is complete waste of people's time to use. Whoever wrote this app should find a new line of work. This looks like a way to force you into using a realtor!","The map and the listing display in this latest version is horrible!  Go back to the previous version, this one is a total failure!","the old version was way easier to use.","If this is a scam to charge people to be able to use the previous version of this app, your plan is going to work. I\u2019ll give you 5 bucks right now for the old version back, no questions asked.","The App keeps crashing, hard to use. Bring the old App back. Don't fix what wasn't broken!!","The old app was better, that said the new one was at least serviceable until what ever update just came out, pictures go half way now so you get half of one picture and half of another. If not bring back the old app, undo the update","Gah, give us back the old app please! This thing is not intuitive at all. It doesn't remember my default search, the map is so dark and hard to look at. Redfin is a lot more enjoyable to use!","I request that you revert back to the old version of the app.  New version is unusable","The previous version before the current update, used to be much better. Unfortunately, very disappointing and very confusing to navigate and search for properties. \nWish they bring back the old version.","App works well on my iPad but is useless on my iPhone. My iPhone is running the latest versions, since I keep hoping the app will fix itself. App developer should revert back to old version before major update. At least with the latest fix to the new version, I can select a city besides the one I'm in BUT it won't register the date so I can find new listings quickly. If you still have the old version on your iPhone before the major update keep it!  I wish I could get it back!  The app developer did a poor job quality checking this before releasing to the public.","Garbage compaired to the other app. What a let down. Why change a good thing. Bring back the old app please.","Please! Bring back the old app until you get the bugs out of the new one. The app crashes on startup.","If the objective of the new version was to crash every 4 minutes and irritate any and all users....then mission accomplished. You must of gotten one hell of a deal on the new version because it is horrible.\nNamaste","Version 4.0.9 is step back. Hard to navigate and hard to look at. Used to be one of my favorite apps.","Should have kept the old app.","Just downloaded the new app and not user friendly at all, compared to the old one! Uninstalling for something else for sure.","Doesn't seem possible to login... The old app was sometimes janky but this new one doesn't doesn't work for me at all if can't even login. Very disappointing. Don't release a new app and try to force users over until the new one is working. I'm going to uninstall and try to reinstall the old one until this is ready.. please leave old one online and remove the constant pop-ups for the new app from it until then.","I hate this upgrade. It\u2019s harder now to find things. I also entered today\u2019s date to show me only new things and I\u2019m getting all kinds of crap. How can I get my old version back? HATE THIS","The new version of this app is terrible. Navigation is harder, the auto-zoom on the map is super annoying, listing information is hidden until you click it open. Everything about it is worse than the old version.","Hate this app.. Bring the old one back. You can't just do a simple search it's extremely frustrating. Guess back to looking for a house the old fashion way.","This app used to be great but then they came out with a new version a couple of years ago that is terrible. It\u2019s now super buggy and UX sucks. Please fire your new product designer and rehire the person responsible for the last version.","I\u2019ve used this app for well over a decade and generally it works well. I don\u2019t ever leave reviews but this app is awful! Won\u2019t let me login, send feedback, search outside of my radius, and the map is now all blue with no street names or landmarks. Go back to the old version and give me access to my account please!","The new app is terrible you guys had a great app already. You received bad advice on whoever made this one for you, not at all viewer friendly. Go back to the version before, massive fail on this one. It's really bad guys. It's like this was someone's first time making an app and they never used apps before In their life. Your previous version was gold.","Brutal app. Go back to the old version","Really bad app. Can't believe that someone did this instead of the old one. Old app was 1000 light years in front of this one. Don't think ill use realtor app anymore.","This latest version is awful! Crashed already. Hard to navigate. \nHorrible screen layout. Change it back!","New version sucks","Bring back the old version of this app! The current one is awful and either crashes all the time or won't even open. So extremely frustrating. This has been going on for weeks! Someone please fix it! What a joke.","Horrible new app. Old app was perfectly fine.","Old version was more user friendly.  This app constantly crashes and the location is never stable.    Would like if old version is put back on update.","New app is terrible. The old one was fine, why change??? Please explain what was wrong with the old app.","The new version is slow, has a bad design and not user friendly.","This is the worst app ever that has been created. The previous version worked seamlessly, but this has never worked as intended/ God.. I wish there was a way to go back to the three-year old version of this app..","It will not take me to the back page","Absolute garbage. A huge step backward. Instead on 'noting concerns' why don't you abandon this new app and go back to the old one, until you find a designer who can improve it.","I just updated this app and now I can\u2019t filter for # bedrooms/bathrooms (amongst other things). Please bring that back!","Let's just say it. The 2021 May version of the realtor app is horrible. The user experience is clunky and slow. It's very difficult to leave the app. The app is so unintuitive. It's a frustrating and annoying user experience. I am so disappointed in this version of the app. Definitely going to seek out any and all other options. I honestly feel that realtor had a significantly more user friendly app prior to this major release. This version is just stupid","The app is not very intuitive/user friendly. I personally preferred the old app.","The updated app (April'21) is terrible compared to the old version. Please bring back the old app!","Please go back to Old design on iOS.","The latest version of the app is garbage and has regressed from previous version.","It took a lot if time to get the previoys one right. I myself sent a lot complaints. Thought the new one would be better, but unfortunately it went back to the status a few years ago:unusable. The look and feel is very strsnge for an app. The search part force me to do more clicks to enter simple criteria. Used a bit, before i figure out how to use map, the app crashed. Strange part is I was forced to use the new one as the old one no longer works while the new one s unusable. Bad decision.","This app is complete garbage. Bring back the old one.","Should go back to the previous version, it\u2019s user friendly, easier to use and less freezing/ glitching... I\u2019m annoyed","Change it back to the old version","I don\u2019t like the new version of this app at all.  The new map view is difficult to use.  Instead of using dots on the map to indicate listings, they now use large rectangles with the price in it.  This causes confusion when there are multiple listings over lapping each other.  Also, the entire app is more difficult to navigate.  And it\u2019s very buggy.  The old version was much better.  They completely re-done the entire app un-necessarily, and made it a horrible experience.  I recommend just going to the website instead.  And not bother with this app in it\u2019s current version.","Horrible app! Why would you discontinue the previous app? It was way more user friendly and intuitive. It's so frustrating using this one. Just scrap this and go back to the previous version","Can we just go back to the old app? This app is not user friendly compared to the old one. The map is too touchy, swiping through photos is glitchy, I do like the different options for the map styles but it's still not as easy to navigate as the old app. The filters are fine, but overall just not as user friendly.","Bring back the functionality of the old one please! You REALLY missed the mark with this.","This newer version is terrible. Every useful option from the old app is gone. One star, should be 0 Edit: the map redisign is one of the most annoying changes re: price pins","Crashes constantly. \n\nBring back the old app and get your money back from whoever developed this piece of garbage. \n\nIt has potential but yet again a company using the public to do their R&amp;D. Don't release something till it actually works. \n\nGarbage","New App difficult to use","With each update, the app gets worse and worse. \nHad the same 7 \"new listings\" for the last month. App crashes. Map goes crazy zooming in and out.  Scrolling is jumpy. \nGo back to old, old version.","The update problems have been fixed and it's back to working well. I prefer this app over all the others yet still wish I could go back to the previous version. \nStill very handy and functional. A great way to stay on top of the market and know what's out there. The website version is better for serious searches, and that's understandable.","Terrible, bring back the old app it was much more user friendly.","New version of this app sucks keeps on crashing just a waste of time now","Go back to the old app","Very difficult to use. Please bring back the old app!","Since realtor major upgrades of there app has been a disaster freezes and crashes , bring back the old version when it was working flawlessly .","Horrible. Bring back the old app! Or better yet make it similar to US realtor which is alot more user friendly.","New version is terrible. Won\u2019t even let you give feedback on the app. \nNot user friendly at all and not easy to navigate. \nBring back old version!","Like the old map easier to use","This version is terrible. I wish I could have the old one back. So many bugs and unusual behaviour in the map listing view and search.","Bring back the old app.","Not so easy to navigate the map and properties. Where is the old version? Old one is much better. Bring the old one back.","I wish I could go back to the old app. The new map interface has these very slow transitions which make it feel sluggish. Useful features like 'new listings' are missing. Classic case of style over usability and it's driven me back to the desktop browser.","Please bring back the old version. This is the least user friendly app I've ever experienced. For more specific details, please read every single review on here. They are 100% right.","This is terrible now. Please bring back the previous version.","Bring back the old version please!","Doesn't open after I did the most recent update to\nTry and see if the previous issues were fixed. \n\nPlease bring back the dollar calculation for the down payment. The new version only has the percentage.\n\nThankfully haven't updated on my iPad yet - If you haven't updated yet don't!!!!","The new app is super glitchy with reduced functionality. Please go back to the old app.","Still terrible. Can\u2019t log in, favourites are gone. Please roll back to previous version.","The new updated format is horrible. Go back to the old way.","New interface is terrible. Where is the list view? The old app had issues but you could view multiple houses in the list view. Forcing the user to swipe for each house is cumbersome. The map section is enormous as well. It is simply not needed. Being able to collapse that would be nice. I think this app is going to be short lived on my device.","The update is awful. Viewing listings on the map has become almost impossible. It zooms into the area unnecessarily close and you have to click on the houses individually to get more details, which works until you have multiple houses in one area and they overlap so you can\u2019t view the others. And clicking on a house to get details doesn\u2019t work half the time as it takes you to some other random house about 5 times before taking you to the house you actually want to view.","This app used to be my favourite! Now it's glitchy and I can barely get to what I want to see. Won't let me choose certain options (ie detached house) and readjusts the map at its own will! Way to ruin a great thing :( don't waste your time people!!!!","Terrible. The dark map is awful. The swiping side decide to view a listing instead of up and down is awful. The split screen between map and listings is awful. You get my point, there is nothing good about this latest update and I will be deleting the app if it does not revert back to the old one. I\u2019d rather go through a local newspaper and look for a listing there","Purpose of technology: Increase efficiency and ease of use to accomplish objectives. This update forces a user to look at one photo at a time and you have to open each listing to get information.  Last version had a list of properties with overviews and details that you could quickly sort through.  \nWhomever thought this was a good idea is clearly not a real estate buyer.","Can only see 9 properties in list view, won't load anymore after that. Figure it out!","Well that's one way to cool the housing market.*UPDATE* thank you for your prompt reply.It is nice to see that filter there but even after reading your reply it was hard to find.The carousel style listings also makes it hard to scroll through new listings. With the housing market what it is,in the 4 areas I check,there were over 550 new listings since yesterday.Seeing 1 at a time instead of 4 or 5 with the same amount of info on screen seems silly. Like showing taxes again but no condo fees?!?","Great to see a version now optimized for iPads. But ... this update wiped out all my searches and favourites and no longer syncs with the web version or my phone. Continuity across all platforms is a key feature. Also while listings by realtor are now available, it is difficult to see enough of the listings without having to open them one by one.","The look of the new app is great, but the map is too busy. Instead of grouping properties in one area, they are all separate, making it hard to select them. I guess that just forces you to scroll through the listings at the bottom. I preferred the old layout, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get used to this one.","Now I can't see all the properties and cannot change sorting options since I updated!  Knowing taxes and being able to filter by size/ # of garage doors would also be helpful.  I'm hoping for a fix soon...","I honestly do not understand how an app can be developed that is this bad.   How is it that you cannot move to an area on a map and then apply certain filters to narrow results?  What happened to being able to select waterfront?  What happened the simple list view?  \nThis is absolutely horrible.","All properties will not show up in my list and half the time it won't find properties as well as lots of times it finds properties that are not even in the price range I set not a great app needs work","Not useful at all anymore. I used to see a house for sale in front of me, use my location in the app and see the house information. Now all I see are multiple listings and I can't pick individual homes on a map anymore. Don't like app anymore!!! Frustrating!!!","This app is very good! I've been waiting for something like this to browse listings on my iPhone and iPad. The website interface doesn't work well when trying to pan around the map unless you're on a computer. One thing I would like to see is the addition of a 'freehold' property filter. Excellent first attempt! Keep the updates coming!","I'm not a fan of the new app. Tapping a numbered circle when zoomed out, zooms me in and shows me individual properties, which I have to tap. Close picture icon is top-right and back arrow is top left; pick one location for consistency. No accounts so my searches and favorites are gone? Slide up panel is slow. Doesn't always detect when I tap on different properties near a currently selected property. One step backwards with this app, which has often been the case IMHO.","Good.. however with the new update, I cannot see any listings in Quebec.. infect in not seeing any listing in Saskatchewan either.","You need to have the option of acreage min-max in the filters.   It is annoying to open property to see if it's on acreage.\nKeeps crashing.  Everytime.   Fix it!","Why did they chance this app? It was good the way it was. The view by map option is so tough to navigate now. The pull up menu gets in the way and basically this nee version is very frustrating. \n\nDont like it at all. Change it back.","Terrible searching experience compared to old app. In the old app I could open a list of properties in the area I was viewing and quickly scroll through them. In this app you have to swipe to the left and go through each one slowly one at a time instead of quickly scrolling in a list view.","Why on earth would you make it zoom in when you try and click on a cluster of listings? If I want to zoom in I will choose to do so myself thanks. As well if I click on a listing I don\u2019t want it to scroll away after I click. Just make it usable for goodness sake it worked better years ago","Your update sucks. Won't even load now. And can you guys show the properties that we have saved and are sold.. Not just take them off","This update at least doesn't crash when opening the app, but FULL of BUGS!  Periodically just crashes. Move map, flips to list, why?  Go back to map and zoom a little, flips back to list, urgh!  Repeat, urgh, repeat, urgh, etc.  This was not tested properly before telease and still needs a lot of work.","The newest update no longer allows you to sign in which makes it difficult to view your favourites on different devices. The map feature needs some tweaking, you do not have the option to view in a list, just swiping from left to right. I prefer the list view instead of the current view. The app is even worse now when leaving the app to go into another one. Before you could leave the app and come back and the current search or listing would still be available for you to view. The moment you leave the app with this new update you will lose your search/the listing you were currently viewing. I enjoyed the Realtor app and was looking forward to the update as the app need an update. Too bad the update was a step in the wrong direction.","This app used to be decent buts now it\u2019s terrible, difficult to navigate, hard to click on a property, zooms in when you are just trying to view a property then pinch zoom out doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s so bad, pls fix.","This app should at least have the option to get a list view of all properties, like the old version, rather than having to scroll through them left and right.  Other than that it\u2019s great!","New version appears to be more stable.  The zooming for the maps is super annoying as it keeps changing your view.  Getting better...","The revamp of the app makes it much harder to use. It zones in on areas that I don\u2019t want, the price banners obscure the map and overlap one another and the individual property details now at the bottom of the page is less functional than on the side like before. \nThumbs down on the update! \nI use this app rarely now.","Can\u2019t filter on most fields and your forced to create account just to view pictures. I am deleting app","Garbage, dont update. The update sucks. First off, bring back the list view. When you look at a list of objects(homes), you scroll down not across. When you select a house and you are looking at the pictures you scroll across. It's pretty simple and it's how people naturally move their hands. Also get rid of the prices on the map, the clutter it creates makes the app hard to use. Makes want to use the browser version of your website, which says alot.","The new UI makes it so much more confusing to use. It\u2019s much harder to filter property specs &amp; look through information. Also, why is the map black? How can we accurately see parks and other feature when this map theme?","I used to be able to select and see favourites either on mobile or online with my laptop. Newest update doesn\u2019t allow you to login and won\u2019t track favourites.","It's really annoying that you can't favorite realtors and your favorite listing don't show up on the map like on the old app.","Showing listings and swiping right to left with big images is not helpful. Smaller images from top to bottom swiping is better. Bring back list views.","Such a great app , destroyed!  Now it's glitchy, can't view by map anymore, closes randomly, freezes at start you name it..","I guess new doesn't necessarily mean improved. I can't even exit the app without hitting a quick access item at the bottom at least a few times when trying(phone requires I hit bottom of screen to bring up control buttons). If you want to make a change that I am sure everyone will benefit from, figure out how to combine multiple listings of same property into one, so we don't have to see the same property in 3 seperate ads(listings regions).","Cannot view all the listings in the property lists!","Every update does something to make the app completely useless.  The latest problem is it won't show you more than 9 properties in the list view.  I've never seen such a large organization, with such a vital online presence, have such a dysfunctional app.","App sucks because of previous comment of not being able to see all properties only loads so many. Stupid","Incredibly difficult to sift through listings on both map and list. Side scroll list of all listing half of the screen is unusable. Not being able to get back to the first photo without swiping back through them all is also a terrible function.","How on earth do you make a real estate app where you can't see the dimensions (square footage) up front. See how Centris does it.","Ever since the last update to the newer look and feel. The app hangs in multiple occasion, even restarting it doesn't help. I had to delete and redownload the app to make it work. \n\nScrolling on the map to see listing is not as smooth as previous version, app constantly pull you back to where you were (not helping). \n\nI like the new feature where it shows red for your saved a listing. \n\nDon't like that the walk score being moved to the bottom of a listing, feel annoyed that I need to scroll down every time for every listing.","Can only see 9 properties in list view since the latest update, very frustrating.","Won't load more then a few properties in list view.","Only can look at 9 of XX (however many property it found) can never see the rest of them. When you do a high price to lower price it freezes up. This is in need of a serious fix!!","Like everyone else, can't scroll down and can only see 9 out of however many properties I search! Fix this!","If looking for properties for sale this is a fantastic app!","Can't scroll past #9 in list view. Can't sort price high to low. \n\nNever had any issues previously and always enjoyed using this app. Latest version has issues please update.","The old version was really easy to use! \nI cannot see the MLS# or address on my favorites once the property shows unavailable, that\u2019s really inconvenient !!","An \"update\" breaks a working app is very frustrating. Please test your software before releasing. Like other reviewers, I can't see more than 9 properties in List view.","To be clear - some properties that show up when using a desktop do not show up when using mobile. Also the map function is garbage. What is wrong with your developers? Will you just admit that this roll out is a failure and reinstate the old app until you get it together?","Whoever is in charge of this app should lose their job, quite frankly. \n\nIt's been like this for a month where you cannot scroll down the list of properties. Huge fail.","It was a good app, but the recent update really obliterated its functionality. Zooming in does more inconvenience than not zooming in. I need a list of properties in an area and not looking to zooming in to see them one-by-one. The list shall be a convenient vertical list and hot horizontal.  Keep it simple! \nI have abandoned this app altogether and I am using Zolo instead.","Crashes all the time and I can't stand when on map view it keeps zooming to only include listings.","The map view should not automatically adjust so that the current properties occupy the entire map, it is disorienting and hampers usability. Also displaying images of houses and the splash page image at the incorrect aspect ratio is inexcusable. \n\nA few other thoughts: it appears that some fake five star reviews are beginning to appear for this app; I suspect that Realtor.ca is getting fleeced by the developers and / or someone in charge of the app. I have never seen such a dramatic decrease in the quality of a popular app before. A roll back to one of the older and much better versions of this important app is warranted.","Removed option to view properties in list view. A real pain if your checking the sane area daily. Also crashes when scrolling properties.","Not a great first impression of the new app. You can't continously view the photos. Once you get to the end you has to slide all the photos backwards to get to the first one again. My favorites are all gone and by the time they fix this they will all be sold! Drop menu everywhere, when you try to slide the bottom display down it moves the map instead (unless you do it just perfectly), picture X in corner had to be tapped 5 times before it closed. So many others.......","It's not a very good app.  For months now I have tried to put in specifications to get a list of properties to view, and when I do, I only ever get to view 9/150 properties.  The screen doesn't load. Tough to buy a house from only 9 options. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb","Getting better. The app doesn't crash. But... Your app is almost fully dependent on good map functionality. So, why is it that when I drag the map to a place and the app refreshes the properties, the map further realigns itself? Sometimes it moves a quarter centimetre. But sometimes it zooms to 100% and I'm now totally lost. Fix this stuff. It shouldn't be that hard...","The new update is giving problems. When i click on the 3 line top right corner to view the houses in a list it only shows 10 when i scroll down to view more it doesn't work, the list doesn't load more it keeps on spinning. Restarted the app same problem, zoomed out the map to at least 80 listing still the same problem. Please fix. \n\nVersion: 3.1.3\nDevice: iPhone\nOS: iOS 10.2.1","This app has been substandard for ages - clearly the team is not seeing value in mobile/online customers. \n\nFilters often crash, you're unable to view more than 5 properties on the list. Also unable to share properties with friends and family. \n\nThe app has been getting negative reviews for years - sort it out!","Need current property tax in listings then it would have 5 stars\nCan shop for house without wasting hours looking at properties that I am not interested in","I liked the old app. This new app does not have the ability to search by price, number of stories, views ie waterfront. I don't like the dark map face. It's too hard to see where parks and other features are. The only improvement I see over the old app is the ability to see which house you are viewing on the map. All in all its a complete failure and I'll continue to use the old app.","Discontinuing an app before the new one is even able to be signed into is rediculous. App asks everytime if I want to share location even though first time I said don't ask again. Photos within a listing do not continually scroll from last pic back to first. Horizontally scrolling through one listing at a time without a smooth scrolling is extremely inefficient. The previous vertical 3 or 4 at a time was better. Do like direct access to the map for directions","Judging by the recent reviews, I\u2019m not the only one who thinks this app could use a fix. Along with random crashing, inability to consistently continue to scroll across photos in a listing without the threat of it just not working, they have a max limit of properties you can add to a favourites list. \n\n However, when a property sells or is removed, they don\u2019t remove it from your favourites list automatically. So you have to go to your list and do it yourself. One by one, because apparently the dev didn\u2019t think that it would be a good idea to give users a way to select multiple listings at a time and delete them all. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, at least I can look at the property that sold, so I can note how much it sold for, and the things I liked about it from the listi\u2014\u201c WRONG. You can\u2019t click back into the listing once it\u2019s removed or sold. It just lives there on the list, taunting you with zero information. Those sold properties you favourited once are just now going to take up space on your limited list until you painstakingly one-by-one remove them (there\u2019s no select+delete option). And your brand new iPhone will still take a few seconds to delete each listing. Which again, you have to delete one by one.\n\n Also, when I\u2019m browsing, if I filter to see only properties with 2+ bedrooms, I want to see two or more bedrooms. Not a 1+1. Same with if I choose 3+ bedrooms..I\u2019m not looking for a 2+1. It needs a fix. \n\n Dev, you gotta listen to the reviews.","Unable to view all listings.","After I updated this application, can not see lists more than 9 on the list view from my iPhone 7 plus.","Bought my house.Like to see again","Can't see all the properties on list mode and have tried other phones too even deleted and reinstalled","But can you please add the strata fees, mortgage payment property tax and Sq of the place and the property age in details.","Crap app.  Only list 9 properties.","This app before the update was 5 Stars hands down. The map was easy to see and read. The filters were easy to find and narrow your search. The app was fast and so accurate. The new update makes it IMPOSSIBLE to see the number of properties available. The map is dark and it crashes CONSTANTLY. Please change it back.","Hard to navigate - I am trying to see what open houses are available and moving the map but it moves back a second later and zooms.  I just want to be able to get a list of open houses, not have to wait, load!!!  I also can't do classic search.  Frustrating!","I can only see 9 properties and it will not load more. It had worked in the past with no problem.","That stupid side tab covers half the screen! There was nothing wrong with just putting the listings for the map area along the bottom, but now I can\u2019t even properly look at the area map to see what neighbourhood I\u2019m searching!","Why can you not sign in to the app so that you can see your favourites on any of your iOS devices?\n\nYou can\u2019t copy and paste the address, although I do appreciate that you can look it up and you give me the choice of Apple Maps, Google maps or Waze. \n\nIt should show you how many days it\u2019s been on the market like the US realtor.com.","Quite simply this is app is broken. Crashes all the time, the geo-map finder feature is overridden by list view. Wait for the next update, hopefully.","Can only see the first 9 listings.  The app needs to be fixed.","The Realtor.ca app is overly complex, and very bad at the basics.  Most people searching want to be able to see the location, price and view pictures with ease on an iPhone or equivalent.  This app makes that experience horrible.  Resizing issues, inability to see the microscopic x to close windows etc.  it's like they didn't even consider small screen users, which I believe is the majority these days. \n\nI wish the data on MLS were licensed.  I guarantee that other developers could make a vastly better app.","Hate the new app. You can't even filter by freehold/condo etc, which is a huge miss. It's more annoying to scroll through multiple properties now because only one property shows per page, &amp; that just doesn't work if I'm looking through 40+ listings - it needs to be easier to scroll through and compare features. And the search feature is not as user friendly as the old version either. Not sure how this version is an improvement? Very disappointing. Will probably use HouseSigma more now instead.","Wish there was an option for NO star rating. Can't scroll through properties in a list as others have already indicated.","Doesn't load the map .\nCan't zoom in or out .\nVery bad .... Don't download this .... You waist your time","Worked great before the update that added prices to the map. Can\u2019t see the roads for all the prices. Filter is fussy. This app is useless now for phone users.","Won't load all the properties after you scroll down the page a bit. Needs to get fixed.","Meh housesigma is getting better specially after this update. Sorry realtor you're not alone anymore. Plus sigma gives sold prices, not that hard to add and people want to see and that would get you more clicks but not from me now.","Not sure why Realtor.ca had completely revamp the entire app, the old one worked flawlessly.\n\nThe new one is unintuitive, sorts listings not by price in list view by default, map shows pricing instead of the number of listings in the area and often stacks on top of each other.","Too much swiping to see only one house at a time. Can't select to see thumbnails or list. Can't choose freehold. I prefer the old app. My 'favorites' from the old app is gone. When in the selected house, can't tell which pictures I've seen from the little dot indicator. Not sure why create a new app when its worst.","Love the ability to see houses on map and click on the indicator to see the house.\nThis app looks made for iphone, need to search if there is one for the ipad.","Enjoyed the last app better. Other than no option to log in and import saved properties (yet) and the removal of \"ownership/title\" options, I really miss the property grouping -&gt; where you get a list of 5 or so properties within a certain spot, and you can scroll through it. With this, you see the groupings but you'll have to zoom into the map even further, won't allow you to see a group as a list, just individual on the map. The property list is now to swipe across and moves all over the map.","The new version is not user friendly. Search by map is painful as it always zooms in more when trying to pick a listing.  Split screen is challenging to use and scrolling sideways through listings is not efficient. Search and filter options are hard to navigate.  Please go back to the old version. I have not seen any new features to justify the change.  Only benefit is the price shows up on the map, but even this feature is obsolete when it is a challenge to select and view the property.","The new app is terrible to use. Hate the map and listing as it is not user friendly. Yeah can not get it to list listings when I select an area on the map. It is slow to respond. I would give negative rating if I could. Want the old app back!!!","This app is a lot less user friendly than the old one. The map feature is basically useless because you only see a few houses at a time rather than a list with all of them. It's very frustrating and incredibly time consuming.","Haven't been able to open the app for 2 days now. Just freezes on my iPhone. The old version was pretty good but this new one is not. While searching by map as soon as you try to move another direction it keeps defaulting to the list view. Super annoying.","The most recent update has made searching and navigating through listings a lot more difficult. Previously I could select a cluster or tap into a specific listing on the map to see what they are. Now all it does is zoom and it\u2019s dodgy on highlighting the listing that I want to view. Fire your dev.","See title of review","It\u2019s hard to select the map icon in latest update as primary way to get to property. Have to be right on it or just zooms in repeatedly. \nAppreciate trying to improve the mapping functionality but it\u2019s not strong solution.","This app has had a ton of issues since the major version \"update.\" It is now functional but scrolling around the maps view is next to impossible due to the fact that it automatically (and instantly!) snaps to 100% zoom on the nearest property as soon as fingers are lifted from the screen. It is SO frustrating - this needs to be fixed! There is also an issue where the UI makes it way too easy to jump back to the default (current location) map view. Both of the above are ver very frustrating. Realtor.ca, you sure are making it difficult to find a listing (I hope you got a big discount from your app devs, as the QC on this release has been just appalling). He old version of this app was fantastic - is it too late to revert?! Please?","Firstly, fire the person who recommended the previous update. \n\nSecondly, why is the list view so small? Make the list view larger from the top to bottom","The map moves every second you never get to tap the place you want to see!","This new update forced me to review an app. I\u2019ve had iPhones since 2010 and have never reviewed an app. I\u2019m not sure what you guys had in mind but this seems like a change for the sake of change and for rolling with a project even if it doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m a tech savvy person - I program and I work with UIs. I will be very blunt - I can\u2019t figure this out and it\u2019s not functioning as you guys thought it might. I talked to four other people who used to use the app and all four are in agreeance. At the very least please offer a classic view if you cannot roll back this update.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been asked to be more specific. I think it\u2019s self explanatory when you read every other persons review. An app like this needs to be to the point and functional, not hidden behind layers of menus and visuals and screens. Take HouseSigma as an example app. Or your previous version. Filters were right there, easily set and applied, and there was map and list view. Could flip between commercial and residential quickly and easily. It took me a while just to figure out how to filter in this new UI - imagine the average older person who would just give up. Why are properties showing up on the home page taking up 80% of the screen when I haven\u2019t customized or set anything yet? It makes no sense.","Since they \"updated\" the app, the format is not as user friendly as they hoped - hate when I can't see local properties in the map but if forces me to a list (even after changing default settings) and now it doesn't even open at all. Shouldn't have messed with an good thing....","I used the older version before this upgraded. It wasn't the greatest but at least it worked. Worst of all, it switches back to list view every chance it gets! It won't allow me to browse the map to see what's for sale in the area!  The app crashes after I load the settings from account.","This new update is simply horrible. The monochromatic dark map is difficult to differentiate the  parks, roads and geography in general. The listing pop up gets in the way when you click a property pin, the listing amounts on the pins is extremely small, can\u2019t seem to save searches, the list goes on. The last version was very usable and should be returned to.","Keeps zooming in and can't see properties.","The previous version of this app was unusable due to constant crashing.  This version seems to have resolved the crashing issues, so far so good!  One thing I do not like is that the thumbnail photos of properties are squished to fit the list view.  This makes houses with a 2 car garage look like a 1 car garage.","App is terrible won't use it anymore.  Can't seem to view all homes in location selected, only shows them on a map you have to individually select each one.  It's definitely not showing all listings.  Why do you update and release an app that does not work.  Did you test before releasing ? Wtf","New Updated review: I like this new update and appreciate the option for light view instead of dark view. I\u2019m happy the app creators listened to their user\u2019s complaints! Thanks!\n\n(Older review) It looks horrible on my phone and is harder to use. I prefer the way it used to be. I hate the new update and layout and the dark map. The map is hard to use and see. I also loved how the old version would automatically zoom in on my location when I went into the maps. \nThe older version was MUCH easier to use.","The old app was far more user friendly. I absolutely hate the changes to the map, it's so awkward now and doesn't not display properties as well as the old map. Lots of finicky clicking here and there to see properties that are near eachother, which becomes very easy to lose track of what you've looked at already. The app also hides the row of buttons at the bottom of my screen which is a minor annoyance but worth mentioning. I could see this being very confusing for less tech-savvy users.","It\u2019s so much harder to view and browse quickly now. What was a 3.5/5 has gone down. Totally inefficient. Horrible for frequent use. \n\nNo more list view. Seriously.. we have to scroll left to right and look one at a time now? Sucks there isn\u2019t much of an alternative.","When you try to zoom in/out the map jumps to some other random spot! It's really annoying and you almost can't use the map.","The new version of the mobile app has no login options so I can\u2019t see my saved favourites.","Take something good and ruin it. App is slow and even slower to navigate. Before i could browse 100s of listing in a matter of minutes and now it takes forever. Need to bring back list view by page, scrolling one by one ain't cutting it.","Smoother than the last version but missing a key feature, the ability to log in so you can see listing favorites from before.","The bottom sheet where it displayed the listings are extremely laggy and not responsive. When I click on a number (a 3 for example) on the map, it kept doing the laggy zooming in until you can see only one listing. I just want to see the listing when I click on it\u2026 and when the list do pop up from the bottom, the price was cut off, to see the price I\u2019ll have to make the list full screen and lost the map view. Every interaction happens on the UI makes me frustrated in comparison with other competitors app I\u2019m using at the same time. I don\u2019t mind the old app, it was not the best but I can find what I need no problem. But not the new app only leaves me frustration\u2026. Please do fix the experience with more testing and smooth out the functionality with native code base maybe?","We can no longer save searches, add filters, only review most recent listings.  Are they trying to bring back reliance on Real Estate Agents again?\n\nIt is nice to see the prices in the new view.","Will not show all of the map since updated","Horrible version. Even the previous version was bad. Aside from the crash issue, the minute you zoom in or out of the map, it changes the map view to list view before it gives you a chance to fine tune the zoom.","Most positive reviews must have been written by real estate agents.  The map view is just unusable.  As soon as you move/zoom it, it refreshes during seconds!  It also takes forever when opening a listing.  You could do way better with that content...","I love the app, but the dark map is impossible to see anything on. I wish there was an option to set it back to the lighter color map like it was or antithetical map service. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb","Once I figured out how to find and use the features, this is much better than it was when the update was first issued. In particular, thanks for adding a \u201clight\u201d map option.\n\nA little problem: if a property on the \u201cfavourites\u201d list becomes unavailable, it stays on the list. I seem to be unable to remove it. Fix that, and we go 5-star.","Do not show sold properties. It only shows not available, and no picture,no listing number. You don't know which one of your favorite houses is sold.","I wasn\u2019t a fan when a I first updated. Though, I do now appreciate that the map has the capability of showing more listings from a broader range than before, to help with comparing over many neighborhoods. I did prefer the list to scroll vertically rather than the new horizontal format.","It pans in and out automatically making it hard to see properties in the area.  Even when swiping side to side the app automatically zooms back to the original spot. Unable to search by MLS#. \nWhat a terrible update. Unless they fix it don't bother.","The map is glitchy and properties don't always show up when you click on them.","Brutal user experience. Crashes all the time. Can't stay on map view in app. So frustrating. Highly recommend improving usability and navigation. No option to remove potential homes from global list to narrow down options. Using Zolo Homes app which is much easier to use and doesn't crash.","Every time you view a property and go back one to many steps to see the map again it boots you out of the map and back to the intro screen. \n\nI really wish this fixed this issue. I'm sure I'm not the only one. I've tried to get used to it. Just can't.\n\nIphone6S plus. Pay attention to your users! You obviously don't care and it shows. This has been going on for a long time. Luckily I found another website I can use that is not Yours","Too many glitches to list...","This makes it so difficult view properties when zooming in and out of the map especially when its a modified search.. who approved this stupid design?","First, thanks for adding an option to filter between $1.0M and $1.5M, in a bubble market like Toronto it is unfortunately useful. Now to the not so good. Prior to the last major update, we could click on the circle in the map to quickly view, and move on to the next circle. Now doing so, makes the map automatically zoom in to that specific circle, and we have to zoom back out, and try to figure out which area of the map we were looking at, prior to the useless auto zoom in. Basically, it render using the map view to look at listings... useless. Please fix, we don\u2019t need auto-zoom when we have our fingers to zoom in IF we want (like we already do in any other maps).","Keeps crashing, won't let me just look at the map view, keeps forcing me to see the listings individually. Used to like using the previous version, now I won't even bother opening this up.","I can't stand navigation this app anymore... It is utter garbage after the update.\n\nPet peeves:\n1) The sign in button that's next to the map/list view selector\n2) the back button that takes you back to the home screen and clears your search parameters\n3) List view doesn't load passed 10","I am not a big fan of this new update, it\u2019s not user friendly as the previous one!\nIn addition, I am not able to login (using iPhone) and not able to see my Favorites (I can see them on the website when I log in but not while using the app!!)\nPlease help","Constantly freezes and kicks you out. Sometimes won't even load. After you search for listings in another town, it will continue to show you properties located close to you and won't load properly. Hate that you can't just see the map and look at the listings by clicking on a specific bubble. Just gives you a huge list. Absolutely hate this update!","Every time you click on a listing from the map that is displayed in the left viewing window, the app recenters the map (right side of screen) on that listing, but the left viewing window obscures the map listing removing the listing from the viewing window, requiring lots of back and forth finesse to actually view the listing. Terrible for browsing. Every time this app is undated it is one step forward, two steps back. Whoever develops this app clearly does not test it sufficiently. This is just another example of a terrible user experience. Time to give up.","The map view zooms in to maximize the zoom to all the properties in view. I don't know if they thought this would be helpful but it actually makes it almost unusable.","I like that this app automatically starts with your default search. I don't particularly like the map filter as it doesn't allow me to see what the land looks like or where the province borders are. I do like that I can see the listing price right on the map.","And I see why now. The new updated app is horrible to use. Why did you change a quick and useable interface into a more spritzy less useful app?! The list view was very handy. Now I just have a sideways scroll view which is useless when wanting to view listings quickly. It\u2019s not tinder\u2026..","You can no longer swipe right to view property pictures in reverse order. The map view no longer shows eg names of local schools, so you have to go back to listing &amp; then go to neighbourhood/community section &amp; try to find the school.

It's so annoying. I don't even want to use it.","Least stable app on my phone. I haven't been able to get it to stay open for more than a few seconds for several weeks now.\n\nBelow represents my thoughts on the app when it was working:\nWhile this is useful for finding properties, and the filter options are enough to narrow down results, the map often does not show properties when there are plenty that appear in list view. You have to back completely out of the search and start over again to get results to appear on the map.","The map search function is so terrible, I don\u2019t know how it was developed this way.  Whoever did it and whoever approved it should be embarrassed.  When you scroll with the map, you see listings grouped together, when you click on the group, it zooms in so close and doesn\u2019t allow you to click on the listing you want.  The map view shrinks and makes the listing disappear.  Seriously, how could you guys think this is okay?   If I could give 0 stars I would.","Could be good. The map always moving its self to centre on property's and auto zooming into them really annoying.","I was really hoping to see some new filters like square footage, parking, etc. So disappointed to not see any new functionality. This version is harder to navigate and hides critical info - when I'm looking at a list of options, it's not helpful to me to just see a dozen pictures of the outsides of condo buildings, I need more info. Realtor has no scam ads, but craigslist has way better functionality.","Updated the app and I\u2019m not impressed with how many features were removed. I lost my entire list of houses that I wanted to check out, can no longer look at just the new listings, trying to focus on one area is challenging as the map just keeps zooming in when you click on a listing, so it\u2019s easy to loose track of what you have already looked at. I can no long create an account to sync up what I looked at on my iPad to my iPhone, and it looks like you have to specifically shut down the app every time you close it so that it updates the new listing when you got to look again.

Hire a new IT guy, this one hasn't got a clue. \n\nLoved the idea of having an account to view saved searches on all devices. But this app is not usable.

Needs a major fix.","I don\u2019t know why when you touch a property on the map it automatically zooms in. The app is not even useable using the map anymore.","Wow, I don't even know where to start. I'm a real estate investor and Realtor.ca is the app I use the most of any app on my phone. The new app is horrible, almost to the point of being unusable. Before, I could scroll vertically through hundreds of properties quickly, now it's so slow scrolling one by one sideways. The map is too dark and difficult to navigate. The filters for properties are now hidden away. Please fix it or just revert back to the old app.","This app always crashes!\nWhen you search for a house the whole screen shifts without you touching it, making it really frustrating to actually look up a house. \nI also don't like how it doesn't show you which house sold, it just disappears from your favourite list. On the old app, it would grey it out so you could at least see which one it was.","Not sure why they changed something that was working perfectly well. It\u2019s confusing to navigate and the map is hard to read from an accessibility standpoint. The \u2018list\u2019 view was much better before the update, so you have to scroll through each listing. Brutal app!","This app is now horrible to use. \n\n- new night mode map is hard to read\n- you can\u2019t see the price of the property if you\u2019re also looking at the map and swiping through the properties (!?!) \n- it\u2019s too easy to miss the tray handle and swipe the map sending your view flying\n- the animations are too slow, making the whole app feel like you have winter gloves on\n- you can no longer search commercial listings by For Sale AND For Lease, you have to choose just one and search twice (important for people looking to lease or takeover a business)\n\nUtter fail. \n\nAre there any good alternatives to this app? I don\u2019t plan to use it any longer...","My spouse and I are looking for a property. IN THE OLD APP (which worked well), we used the same email based sign-in to share favourites. \n\nIf one of us spotted a great place and added it to favourites, it immediately showed up in the other person\u2019s favourites list. This saved us so much bother compared to sharing each property. \n\nNot only have all our old short list properties disappeared, there is no longer a way for us to maintain a shared favourites list. \n\nWe also hate all the other things everyone else hates.","This app is complete garbage. When you go to the map to see what area you are interested in it automatically switches to a list view and kills the map. Completely useless like this. Can't see how they release such a bad app.","The original version was functional and easy to use. This new update is extremely frustrating. The perpetual dark mode style map does not flow well and listings are hard to see. Touching a listing on the map brings up a blank page and it is difficult to move the page around just to view a listing. I cannot see how realtor.ca approved this update before releasing it. Better to throw this one out and revert to the previous version.","The map jumps around when I zoom as in will not stay zoomed to the level I want. Will not let me see measurements in imperial, gives me an error that the account can't be synced. Won't let me change the open house dates to see just one day, only lets you see them for an entire week. Brutal to the point that I avoid using it. These do not seem like difficult issues to fix!!","Odd to take such a step backwards. Searching by new listings is harder. The expand/collapse sections of search filters and info in listings adds no value and makes the browsing experience slower. When you click a listing in a map, you should see the address and price in the quick view below. Bundling nearby listings is way more convenient than having to zoom way in to click an individual listing on the map. And the upward animation when you click a listing is frivolous and slow. Simplify!","They made it horrible, where is the list view?","I can't even see the map it is so dark, useless","The new app sucks. Not user friendly at all. No options to search for multi-unit, commercial etc. I thought the last app wasn't great but this one is a dogs breakfast. After your reply, I have located the residential or commercial toggle but I still can't find how to locate the properties on map view which is critical. And I will still insist that the original app is inferior to the new one. It's not user friendly.","This new app is terrible and hardly mobile friendly. The map is so small since half the screen is taken up by listings making it difficult to scroll through neighbourhoods. The search by date function-which is very helpful for keeping tabs on new listings (that might very well be gone in 2 days so you don't want to miss them) is still showing all listings on the map and in the feature. Not loving this change.","Your new upgrades when searching via maps is very frustrating to use. Eg. When you are searching in a particular area on the new version, the pictures of the listings in the area pop up and cover 1/2 the screen covering up the map (&amp; if you minimize the pics, they pop back up showing ALL the listing in the area  when you select a listing \u2014and it can be confusing &amp; irritating). The old version you could tap the area and the listing would pop up in a \u201clist\u201d format . That was easier to see and navigate/scroll through available listings....and it didn\u2019t cover up the map unless you tapped on that area. I don\u2019t want to see the other available listing pics in the area UNLESS I CHOOSE TO SELECT IT. It takes too long to work through now. Why did you have to go and change a good thing? The last version was very simple to use. Please think about changing back! The only thing that Ian good about the new app is the price is listed on the map. Thanks.","Sometimes slow to load, and not as many properties as the web site, but convenient and enough to give you an idea of what properties are available and their cost.","This new app has a miserable interface. I'd check out listings at night but I can't see myself using this new version because it's so frustrating. The listings don't automatically load for a region.","The new update makes this app unbearable to use. The map takes forever to load. The sliding info tab at the bottom of the screen in map view takes up half the screen and I still doesnt show the details you want (price, address, etc). The red bar at the top should be much smaller. I used to have \u201cfavourited\u201d searchs. Dont know what happened to that...  Bring back the old app! I hope I buy a home soon so I can stop using this app.","I've been using realtor.ca on the app and the website for months, ever since they updated the app I've basically stopped searching for a new home because the glitches are SO frustrating. The app always quits every few properties, I hate that I can't browse anymore in map view without being automatically given the list view (I hate list view!! I want to click on the bubbles on the map because location is the most important factor). Sometimes I can't even open the App at all. Whoever was hired to update the app needs to take a hike and these bugs need a serious fixing. Super disappointed.","Moving the map around takes a while to reload the listings in view then it moves the map for you to center on all the listings. It then closes any listing details you had open. This is a very frustrating experience. \n\nThe number of things you have to click on when starting the app is ridiculous. For example, now I need to explicitly close a window trying to sell me a mortgage. This is a degraded user experience. I would eagerly use a different service if this weren't a monopoly in this country.","Terrible. Can't view listings as list anymore. Have to scroll sideways and each swipe only reveals one property. Good job developers! Turned a 4 star app into a zero. You're about to lose tons of users. Starting with this one!","Doesn\u2019t let you login to retrieve your favorites. Cannot see freehold within filters anymore.","They just updated to a new version which I do like, but every time there is a number on a dot (for multiple listings) and you click on it, it zooms in and spreads them all out. Super annoying and makes it take way longer to view properties.\n\nUpdate to my last review\u2026 I had to stop using it because it\u2019s maddeningly use now and this was one of my favorite past times looking at houses on the market. Hopefully they fix the stupid map soon cause I won\u2019t be using it again until they do.","This new interface is so difficult to use, please bring the old one back!\n\nWhere is the account login?\nCan it just show the property that I click on the map view, instead of showing all search results in the view? It\u2019s sometimes so confusing.","This version of Realty.ca is just awful. It crashes all the time. I find it more difficult to navigate. The pics look like they were taken by a kid. When you scroll down to view the houses listed all pictures look too thin and too high. Also we can no longer enlarge the pics to see the details of the house. The previous version sure was 100% better!!$","Anytime you move or zoom the map out, the app refreshes and changes your view and zooms in too far. Super frustrating.","Disappointing to not be able to filter for property features like number of bedrooms, etc. This makes it too difficult to find desirable properties and extra work to sift through so many listings.","Too many glitches when viewing properties, photos load 50% of time. Map function is complicated as it zooms too close, missing properties for sale in city you search in. Zoom out too far and you get properties in surrounding cities. Has potential to be useful, but unfortunately it's awful.","Horrible change. Can't sign in. Map shows ALL listings when searching by date. Dark colored map is awful. Couldn't be more disappointed.","Has all the properties to look at !","Finally, a useful app.  No BS, this app actually shows you all of the information for a property that you need.","Awesome for simplicity when looking for a Home, have not found an option for a gallery of you instead of the map to numbered location with view.","This is much improved from the old app, however I cannot find where to log in anymore. This is a needed feature as I go between my phone and the desktop site regularly. Until this functionality has been restored I'll have to use the website instead of the app to be able to view my favourites across the board. However, I'm so happy to see you've updated the options for sharing besides only email.","Gr8app but just got price range blank out and can't see filters need to fix this","The latest new map features are horrendous completely unusable not sure who thought it was a good idea to continuously zoom in every time you click a label on the map \u2026","This app works very well. I've been using Zillow for US properties, and been looking for a comparable Canadian site.  This one is very good, but I agree with other reviewers that the filter for property type could be expanded to a bigger list of options.  I'm enjoying it a lot!!","The new up grade sucks \ud83d\ude21\nCan\u2019t see the streets the land switch can\u2019t see anymore either and it\u2019s so slow \nWish they go back \nDeleted it until it\u2019s fixed","No more crashes on iPhone 5. Searches are saved. Viewing photos in landscape mode could be improved - there is no full screen view. Also, I miss viewing all results in list view. But... It's working again.","Dark mode map view, horrible.\nHorizontal scrolling, horrible. Bring back vertical listings.\nImage scrolling, horrible. Pictures should be in a loop so after last picture you should loop back to first picture.\nFilters useless!\nDeserves zero stars!","Filters are harder to access and when looking at pictures it doesn't allow you to scroll backwards first to view the backyard. Why is the background so dark? It's hard to look at. The old app was great! Why fix what's not broken?","Can't use map to find properties anymore.  Not as many options.  I used to really like this app, but now it's worthless.  Taking it off my phone.","I miss the old app. Being able to zoom in on the map and click \"list view\" was easy and user friendly. The way the new \"list\" is presented now does not let me see multiple homes at a time. Looking at the map is not user friendly, I want to zoom in on a specific area and see all the listings, not click and be taken into specific neighbourhoods. This may be beneficial for GTA and Toronto, but not for smaller cities.","Map keeps moving and readjusting as soon as you try and go in map view.  Very very frustrating","I\u2019m enjoying the update, it is definitely an improvement over the old app in terms of design. I have 2 main complaints: 1. The animations within the app are quite slow, I wish they were sped up. And 2. The map needs a \u201cdaylight\u201d display option. Satellite view is good, but I do not like the dark \u201cnighttime\u201d map view, as it is really hard to discern land, water, parks, forests, rivers, etc. from each other.","I switched to using REW, who clearly reads the feedback about this app because their web page is more usable than this thing. \n\nCame back to give Realtor a try. It\u2019s somehow worse. \n\nSome things have gotten better (search filters in map) But it crashes almost immediately and map view is a mess. \n\nWhy group property together until you get zoomed to street level? Why group property at all? \n\nIt\u2019s a user experience nightmare. \n\nSwitch to REW.com - this app clearly isn\u2019t getting any better.","This was one of the most often used apps for me checking listings weekly or on the go in some neighbourhood but after recent update it just doesn't work for me any more: it can crash on map at any time, I can't filter say townhouses any more, there're bugs with showing/hiding list view when dot is tapped on map and the list of issues can go on and on. I wish I could install old version back.\n\nNow even worth with 3.0.1 update, the app always crashes at launch screen","Don\u2019t like the map in the new version. Previously, I would open the map if I saw a \u2018for sale\u2019 sign and I would find the listing. Now, when I use the map feature it shows listings by other criteria like newest, lowest price, highest price but to find the listings by proximity is a pain. I usually can\u2019t find the right property and it\u2019s frustrating","I don't like the dark blue map. I cannot understand the streets layout and I don't see railways, only if switch to satellite mode, which is inconvenient for me. Also, filter for newest date doesn't work for me, when I select current date it shows me all available houses.","Like the map view","I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but when browsing in map view the app automatically zooms in on available properties (to MAXIMUM ZOOM) every time that you scroll the map. This is extremely frustrating, particularly if there is only one available property in your search area, where is will zoom in so far that you can't even tell what area you're looking at on the map anymore. So forget trying to browse for properties in a specific area. (I mean who wants to do that anyway?) :p","Won\u2019t clear sold listings from Favourites list. Is there a way to do this?","It was one of the best apps until the update. It crashes all the time and jumps to a list. No chance to see it on the map, rendering this unusable.","The app was fine. Worked really good. Now it crashes constantly and I can't flip to list view anymore. Seems I need to tap on the map to view a property.   Then CRASH!!!","Can't find lease properties anymore","Night view is really hard to see, no more search possibilities for land, commercial, residential and overall a harder to use app.","The latest release has been horrible. The app keeps crashing every 2 seconds. You cannot scroll the area map anymore it keeps refreshing results while you're trying to move the map to specific area.","The map is super annoying now, it\u2019s clunky and bad colours. The scroll list at the bottom has a lot of info cut from the lower edge. I\u2019m not sure what kind of phone it was designed for. Also I want to search for properties by sq ft, especially now that apartments try to cram too many \u2018bedrooms\u2019  into a tiny footprint.","This latest update is horrendous. The auto listing on map makes it difficult to move around on the map without a list of properties showing up. The app crashes regularly and the saved searches do not display results when there are actual results. Very, very poor design and implementation. Has this even been qa'd?","The map is too dark and unreadable","...would still like to see option to sort listings from newest to oldest.","The recent update in April 2021 has taken away all order to the app.  No longer able to view a simple list, now you need to scroll through large format photos to in smaller areas. Honesty not well thought out at all.","I can\u2019t view the app without it freezing and crashing within seconds of opening it.","Why is there only a dark blue map or satellite option?   Can we have the normal map back please?????   Did you get a deal on a crappy dark blue map or something?  Why no normal map option - only dark blue or satellite? Why?","This version is unusable , can't see anything just struck on main starting page","This app just saved me a bunch of money in real estate because I can't view (and therefore buy) any properties. Thanks, Realtor!","Lists sold properties crashes lags freezes","Scroll down to see filters","Went from 5* to 2*. It\u2019s no longer easy to use and not very difficult to search listings by map or by list. The map is dark coloured! Favourites are hard to find.  Going to exclusively use house signma now.","Pictures won't load, app crashes frequently and it takes forever to reload properties after you move the map.","The new updated Realtor app is terrible. I can\u2019t read the map, it\u2019s dark, the general functionality is lost, sorting through listing on the unreadable map is confusing.

Not the order of every property from new to old. Then clearly shows where the property is located.","Where are the listings? The old app (which I still use) has more listings than the new app. Isn't it just pulling the data from the same database? Also, I hate the fact that the new app needs to zoom in (someone multiple times) to view the specifics of that property. It's very annoying and not an easy way to view the property.

I dont know why anyone would prefer a dark map over any actual map that shows better detail. How does blue represent land on a map and somehow black is the water? Literally the only app that I use with such a terrible map. Considering how important the map is for the function of this app. Also rather a search bar instead of the magnifying glass icon. Having the prices listed on the map would seem like a useful thing but it clutters the map way too much.","I spend more time trying to zoom out on your map than looking at actual properties.

It used to be much easier to navigate the map to see what properties we're available. Please revert back to the way it was.

Downloading full sized pictures is painfully slow and often ends with a \"connection error\". But more importantly, it doesn't consistently show all the properties in the current map. Sometimes if you wait a second or two after zooming or panning, the rest of the properties appear. Sometime not. \n\nThese are just bugs, and I'm sure could be fixed, but it looks like this app was rushed to market before it was ready.","The update makes it more difficult to filter only new listings. I liked being able to select New Listings only. And the map is super dark and difficult to read.","Not thrilled. The back button is very inconveniently placed (top left?!), can no longer see a list view based on results (giant boxes to scroll through left/right), takes forever for everything to load, why is everything giant sized?!, every property detail need to be expanded as they are collapsed by default (again, because everything takes up so much space!), not friendly for searches.

You can\u2019t see more than 9 listings in the list view when you do a search anywhere other than where you are currently located on the map. For example, if I do a map search and look around cottage country rather than a search in my area, then click on list view, I can only view the first 9 listings even if 50+ are posted. I\u2019m not the only person this is happening to. I've seen others write the exact same complaint on these app reviews as far back as a year ago.","I really like the App I can be my own Agent to research prices and info on properties.

This new version for \"a better user experience\" is worse and unusable. Navigating the app is clunky and unintuitive. Selecting a property only brings up the photo, it's another swipe to see the quick details.

All favorites have been deleted (even from my account when logging in on the web). Can no longer sign in. Map is difficult to use and no option to have an easy to scroll list of properties. Thankfully Redfin is a good alternative.","There are not enough filter settings for example if you are searching for a house and want a minimum land size, you can\u2019t choose that as an option. Only when using the website was I able to get land-size to come up where I can choose how big I want the property to be. When using the app the only way to select land-size is to choose \u201cvacant land\u201d and then input your desired acreage. This is not a good way to see it as then I am only seeing properties without any building, only land. I would like to see both.  Also the sharing option is horrible, worst I have ever seen actually. Like it\u2019s 2020 why can\u2019t I share with SMS or through Facebook messenger. Would not suggest this app unless you don\u2019t have too many needs or wants in a house other then bedrooms and bathrooms. Also you might as well mail your phone to the other person you want to show the property to because that\u2019s about how out dated this app is and email is horrible and not as responsive as SMS. Also... the app glitches constantly and I have to clear the app cashes, open it again and search again for the properties. Within a 10 minute time span it would stop at least 2 times. Please fix your app, people are using it to buy probably the biggest investment of their life.","I don\u2019t usually write reviews but for this app I have to.

I have the newest version of the app. \nThere is no direct link to advise the developers of the issue. \nThe app will show results on the map page but when you switch to list view it will only show the first 9 results. Even though there are many, only 9 are provided. The ability to organize the results with highest price first also only gives 9 results to view. \nWhen it used to work, this app was the best. Now I find I have to use a desktop computer or go to the mobile browser in order to get the results I am looking for.","Would be helpful to see the property tax information as well","This new app is the epitome of the old saying \"if it ain't broke, dont fix it\". I don't know what had to be done for this app to be \"updated to pave way for future improvements\" as the old one was already great. Now, it's just extremely clunky. Most frustrating is when you click on a property, half of the time it'll show a completely different, irrelevant property. Also, when you go back to a previous picture, half of the time it'll kick you out of the property you're looking at.","Maybe if they ad the price for what the property was rented / sold it would be better.","This new version of the realtor app is so frustrating to use. Showing listings horizontally one-at-a-time instead of vertically in a list is so inefficient. Viewing photos is slow. Switching between map view and \"list\" is awkward. The Top red toolbar takes up so much screen real estate that could be used for showing actual real estate. The old app wasn't great, but this new app is so frustrating that I've switched to using other apps like zolo and house sigma.","I didn\u2019t think it was possible to have a worse UI/UX than the previous version of this app, but this redesign has me longing for those days. It\u2019s almost impressive how bad this is.\n\nEdit: wow it gets worse somehow. There is no list view anymore? A side scrolling carousel view is not an optimal way to view more than 3-4 options.","I like the price feature on the map but everything else about this new app sucks. It's not intuitive to normal gestures. Why doesn't it list square footage anymore either?","Love that I have easy access to my favourite listings. The only thing I wish is that I can see the listing that is no longer available...so that I know which property sold.","The app was fine before but now I can\u2019t see the parking information listed?? Why would you want to remove that??","I use this app on my iPhone. It\u2019s competent but less than ideal. \nWhat I like: \n- Good general search \n- Mostly up to date listings\n- Allows user to turn images sideways when sending to a TV (not all RE apps do that). This makes for seeing larger images and details of prospective houses (like a magnifying glass of sorts)\n \nWhat I don\u2019t like\n- When searching for a specific address that address doesn\u2019t come up as an option. It sends you to a general area and there could be multiple properties for sale there \n- Other apps put specific selling prices as icons representing the homes for sale. That allows users to prioritize which properties they look at first. This app does not. \n- The Sigma app tells you each time the property was listed over the previous 10-15 years. It also tells you the selling price. That helps you make your bid. This app provides no such previous listings or selling price. \n- This app doesn\u2019t allow you to text a listing to your spouse, just email.","Not showing all propertys","Not ready. In addition to the other comments , Crashes when you try to search by date. You cannot see where parks and other geographical features are with the new map colour. Using the satellite feature does not show park boundaries as the old map did. The group viewing needs to come back. Same property listing on different boards should be grouped into one, because the view is too messy with the prices now included.","App crashes randomly, won\u2019t let me view prices so I have to guess until I get the correct price parameters in. It used to be a flawless app what happened??","Can\u2019t see prices. Have to guess on all the filters","It doesn\u2019t load any properties anymore when you zoom in. Montreal region","Would like to still see the property picture when it sells for a week or so with Sold on it and the offer price would also be helpful","Why can\u2019t we get a landscape view?","A major downgrade from the previous App. Not user friendly at all. Extremely difficult to search in map view and the new method of having to swipe thru 1 property at a time in the list view is poor and adds a lot of unnecessary steps. In addition, no login feature. Would recommend using the desktop version instead.","Good app, convenient for browsing MLS listings and searching properties. One improvement suggestion which should not be difficult to add: you should be able to remove expired listings.","Filtering broke.  Can only see a few properties or none when filtering. For example There are 0 houses on the market for under 800k ?","Can you maybe change the filters as when you use the dark setting and are spinning for price, rooms, bath etc - you can\u2019t see what it\u2019s set too","This update is absolutely terrible. Night mode is hard to read and slow (satellite mode is not good when looking at large areas as you can't see the roads). It's hard to move back and forth between listing and map mode. Truly hate everything about it.","The newest \u201cupdate\u201d is horrible. There should be an option to go back to the previous, much better version which I could actually use. This version is useless. The map is impossible to see (who thought that a black map would be a good idea??), I have to keep scrolling down to see what should be on the screen that I am looking at and nothing makes sense. Horrible. I will have to find a more useful app to look for properties.","I can\u2019t view any of the scroll options??? I have an iPhone pro max. This needs to be fixed ASAP, I can\u2019t view property options or even the price filters. It\u2019s completely useless now.","Update is certainly less buggy than the last version. Would like to see notifications on new listings that match your selected criteria. Also would like to be able to eliminate listings by square footage as well. \n\nWill we see and iPad version??? It's very much needed.","Overall useful app with reasonable layout and functionality.   I\u2019d like to see which properties are no longer available (from my favourites) and sale price.  Loading a listing rate seems slow but could be at my end.  Maybe the rich realtors need to buck up to pay for some improvement.","Updated to the latest version thinking that would fix the glitches. NO! Instead I lost all my favourited listings and saved searches. I also hate the fact that I can no longer see the properties in a list form. Only on property and then swipe for the next one.","This is a NIGHTMARE.  Can't view by map, goes into a never ending loop.  Now it's not even showing photos unless you go into desktop mode.  It's the most useless and frustrating app EVER.  Why did you ever get rid of the previous version when there was NOTHING wrong with it.  I can't send this review without a star rating.  It doesn't deserve even one star!!!","When I go under property to select the criteria  whole list is blank for all categories.","This app has lost crucial functionality. Unless I am missing something, when viewing a list of your selected favorite properties there is no view in map option. Not only does this option seem to be missing, but the incredibly useful \"route planner\" is gone. I thought that updates were intended to bring improvements. This new version has lost crucial functionality. I have reverted to the older version.","I like the app but wish user could remove listings that they\u2019re not interested in. And also use keywords they don\u2019t want to see. But overall very good app.","Most homes I see are already sold.\nFrustrating!","No more Sign In. Cannot view your saved Favourites \nThe map is unusable\nList view is gone\nIt\u2019s HARDER to view/buy a house \ud83d\ude2c\nPlease roll back to the previous UI/version","Miss the old app. new app layout sucks the listings are displayed horizontal now doesn't scroll as easy and it's hard to navigate no list view anymore. can only type in city address, used to scroll on the map and see all the properties for sale can't do that anymore. Disappointed feels like im not seeing all the available listings in the area. I live in a area that has many little towns close by maybe 15minutes apart but I have to individually type in the towns to see all the listings now.","The features it has are great but I do wish we could text properties to friends/family instead of email and the header when flipping the phone to landscape view makes the picture impossible to see without moving it around.","I like being able to explore properties that are for sale. I especially like the fact I can look at multiple cities and see what is happening.","Can\u2019t see the writing in sub sections. It\u2019s there but you can\u2019t see it. I reinstalled and it still doesn\u2019t work.","The new Realtor App is a big step backwards from prior version. It is not as user friendly and is poorly designed. Unable to see the map and list of properties together. On iPad the App has a half inch black bar on all four sides thus reducing effective viewing area. Listings are slow to load (if they load at all). This is unuseable.\nRealtor - please go back to the old app that worked well!","When I open the extended filter view non of the filters show up","I am using iPhone 11 Pro Max, same as my wife\u2019s phone. When I go into filters &amp; pick a drop down to pick \u201cHouse\u201d or \u201cDetached\u201d, I can\u2019t see the items on the list. It shows blank but it is fine on my wife\u2019s phone. Both are exact same phones and I have tried to uninstall and reinstall the App already.","Extremely bad update as of recent. Unable to select a \u201cgroup\u201d of homes to view on map dependant on location. A bunch of listings show up and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve viewed them all?\n\nPlease revert to old system.","Who is the genius that decided taking away search functionality would be a good idea? \n\nHorrible update:\n-map color makes it harder to read the map (dark blue on darker blue...really?)\n-inefficient use of screen space...why is the top banner so big?? I know I\u2019m on the realtor.ca app, I don\u2019t need a giant red banner taking up space that could have been used to see more of the map. \n-what happened to the filters? Now I have to wade through completely irrelevant listings","When I click list view, I only see a few properties, I want to see all of the ones on the map in a list format.","Most of the time it shows no property found, even when I just passed one.","When I zoom out it shows 76 houses available however there are only a few","Set price ranges but only get properties outside the range specified. Set property type and get properties that do the meet criteria This app is worthless. Do not install it's a waste of space.","Right now I can\u2019t filter high to low or when you are under bedroom I can\u2019t see or filter anything.","Horrible compared to the previous one. The old list view of properties was much better. The old 7ser interface was better. I can't even find a way to view properties with only a certain amount of bedrooms or bathrooms. Having each property in map view represented is messy rather than a stack is messy and makes it difficult to view properties.","The app does not show property tax amounts","The old app worked better, this one doesn't want to let me zoom in on pictures, and it shows Every house individually (the grouping in one location is gone), requiring you to move the map around more, the only new thing I like is they now have the property tax. But they fumbled the ball on this one, I still would prefer the old app. EDIT: they did an update,now the app will not let you flip through the listings properly. I have deleted this app from my phone. If I could give it 0 stars I would","I don\u2019t like how you can\u2019t easily seat for free hold property","I wish you could show only favourited listings on the map view.","Does not load properties properly, can't search for new listings as old ones show up anyways, only shows rental units when searching for sale and doesn't show within price min and max values.","......When change happens you're hoping for improvement.....not in this case....The old app was far better. The app developers made the app worse. Can't sort on vacant lands and navigation is horrible. Will be deleting this app. And I used the original one for about a decade. And if replying....please do not reply with generic response. Please do something about ...Map scrolling issues ...It's too dark ...Can't find area of type of property such as vacant land. ...not easy to work with.","Nothing to explain... u see something different through the app and then you see the property and it is a piece of crap.... like crap!!! Wasting time. Realtors!!! Stop being greedy and stop making us losing time... and .. HONESTY is what we need!!!","Used to like this app but if you look at HouseSigma you get way more information such as listing history and sold properties which is really helpful.","App is defective.  Blank screen when choosing property type etc froM map view on iphone 11.  No good.","Can't pick any preferences? Why would I want to see every available house on the market. Com'on..!","Unable to see comments on pictures that you can see in your browser","It\u2019s not super detailed, unable to share and it\u2019s not an all inclusive search for properties available, only the ones who use Realtor App.  There are a lot of properties that are not on here.  Maybe Realtor should do more advertising to make sure Realtors actually upload the properties on here.","Update to review: sadly I'm using less and less this app, user experience is getting worth. The latest update (Android) photos no longer snap on scroll. Pins indicating multiple listing (2) click on it, map zooms in until able to split the listings, which often ends up zoomed in at a stop sign level?? Clicking a pin shifts the map, which often automatically select another pin.

It has been made completely useless as it is virtually impossible to find listings in a specific area. Is this by design perhaps? CommFree while not perfect provides better information.

One testified junk app ever","This got to be one of the worst update ever for any app in the world.  Simply unusable! How did this even pass internal approval process. I stopped using it.","This app used to be amazing yet the recent update made it one of the worst apps... fire who ever designed user experience on the new app... Please hire professionals to do this...","The old version was clunky but at least it kind of worked. This new release crashes consistently.

Who actually thought this was a good idea? No thanks.","I've never used an app that crashes so frequently. Even after multiple updates, the issues still haven't been fixed.

Lost all previous favorited properties. Would not recommend this app.","Compared to Zillow this is absolute garbage. It is unusable.","Who releases a bug riddled app like this??? Really?? Development folks should be ashamed. No UAT process followed for sure... They fix one issue and create 2 more","Oh boy, what a downgrade.

Get HouseSigma app. Far superior in everyway. It's pretty clear the mark had been missed here. I'm sorry but the blue map was a terrible idea and telling people to switch to satalite view, like they are to stupid to realize its there, is not a solution and is dismissive. More and more alternatives are becoming available for people and now is the time to listen and work with people or you will be left in the dust.","Blue on Blue Maps what were you thinking!!! And Pins that never get bigger and hard to read. Incremental change is good. You didn't need to trash your old app. This is a complete mess.","You'd think they can come up with a more user friendly app given that they have a monopoly on the real estate market.","A useless replacement for an app that worked really well, why? The search function takes some finding, each individual property has to be viewed rather than a thumbnail list, it is all rather clunky, cheap feeling and basic. Is this really better than what it replaced?","Poor menu","This new app is garbage. The older app was far easier to navigate.","Fast and shows recent postings 1st","Terrible app that needs work. I fight to touch my back button because it overlaps with the more options menu.

Less filter options that work.","Completely garbage","I read the other reviews and thought they must be exaggerating probably exaggerating. They were not. How do I put this? This app isn't a \"fixer-upper\", it's a teardown. It was apparently designed to showcase realtor-promoted listings rather than help users find listings that meet their needs.","A truly appalling app. The map is barely usable in its permanent \"night mode\" and the satellite view doesnt help. I appreciate that the old app probably needed a refresh, but this abomination isnt it.","If I could give this app zero stars I would definitely have done so.

I really don't understand it when a company releases an updated app how they can get it so wrong. This went from a decent app to a complete fail. Look at all the other reviews. You guys should get this fixed quick.","How long before you find a company that can actually build the app we all want to see? What's worse is the app did work at one time and now it's screwed:( lame people, really lame.","This app is absolutely ridiculous garbage. Whatever geek squad incubator developed this needs to be released from their employment immediately.

Freezes then crashes within 10 seconds.","No need to say more.","I like my previously app","Use it all the time. Well designed. I like this newest version.","Streamlined. I like the new app, maybe some of the other reverie comments have already been implemented. I was able to use the map to move it and zoom. The one glaring thing missing is the user account. Can't sync between app and PC so took away 1 star.","Very difficult to navigate, poor layout, annoying text box placement.

Go to the team that developed the new app. Fire them all. You can't save this train wreck. In life, sometimes you have to realize a bad investment and simply cut your loss.","Crashes, harder to use than their original app. I'm now having to go on the website instead of using this app because it's horrible.","the new design killed what was once a beautiful, practical app","Poor layout","The app doesn't let you login and save your profile across devices. It should let you transfer your profile from the old app. This wastes a huge amount of my time. Also cannot save realtors or even a profile.

I lost all my favorites and it no longer syncs with the web version???","Still crashing!! Deleted it and re-downloaded it. Still crashing.","Crashing every 1 minute. The question is that, if you don't know who to develop an App why touching the old System/App. At least the old system didn't crash and work fine.","Terrible. How do you release a new version and slide backwards? Are you trying to force folks to use Redfin?

It should still be in beta testing.","Just when I thought the 2019 Yellow Cab app couldn't be beat as worst Canadian app, Realtor.ca beat all the odds.","Absolutely bonkers. Of course it isn't enough that Realtor.ca has a monopoly over the space, but no. It gets worse. The app is absolutely horrendous. It is like they didn't remotely consider how someone would, you know, buy a house. No login, a default page that lists nearby homes (why??), minimal customization. Designed to frustruate. Oh but you can connect with a Realtor. That part works. I understand this app is a word in progress but this alpha shouldn't have been released.","ouch. very similar to the other reviews. No sync with the website login? shame on you guys to release this app without that feature.","It's now unbearably slow","Omg - not user friendly. Have to search around to find filters. Go through so many steps to get to a final photo. Can no longer scroll backwards in photos or continue the the loop when scrolling - its a hard stop at the last photo. Not to mention the interface is darker and doesn't feel as nice. Over-all way less user friendly and labor intensive. I'll try out other recommended apps. This 'upgrade' was more of a downgrade.","Horrible app. So much potential. I don't understand why these developers are still employed. Angry birds has better developers. If it's not crashing. It's not even opening. Stop worrying about changing the app all the time and worry about fixing it. Hopefully someone else steps in to deal with this app.","Can not sign in with an existing account and import previously saved favourites?","Not a user friendly app at all.

Why replace a mediocre app with a horrible one. This has almost no functionality and a worse interface.","So buggy, always crashes, favourited listings always are lost, map won't stay where you want it, have to continually delete and reinstall to make work if at all. Terrible App! I Think this is my first bad review ever.","Easy to use and intuitive. I like the split screen and the highlight of viewed house info on the map. There is no lag.

This is very important info in deciding what property you can afford.","Buggy.","The last version worked and the upgrade won't launch at all.","Terrible ux and usability, why would they replace 'okay' app with 'worse', you need to be very patient to use this app. I wonder if this app was tested before launching.","Enjoyable using","I hate the new app. It's not very intuitive. And is difficult to navigate. I have stopped looking at houses because the app irritates me so much. Why was it changed?","UI is not as friendly or convenient as the old app. Seems like this is the first concept of the app which should never have been put on the app store.","Super slow. More details are missing from the old app.","I'm surprised this was released (and the old app discontinued) when most of the useful functionality has yet to be implemented in it.

Thank God I can still use the original app.","Where are the commercial listings? Why is app name tagged to homes ?","Ok","This app is clunky and crushes within seconds %95 of the time. It looks like it's from 2006. I would recommend hiring a new team for app development.","Should've stuck with the old app","The old app was outdated but this is something else....","A generous 2 stars. At the moment I find it extremely hard to use. Is there a way to switch between imperial and metric as there was in the old app? I also do not like the way the filters are set up, nor how things are now listed. What was wrong with the old app that it had to be replaced? It was easy to use including if you were new to the app. All of our favorites are gone. Have to re find them. Gets 2 and not 1 star because maybe it will get better with use. MAYBE....","Whoever made this mess saw billable hours and stayed waaay to late. Never thought about the user? We don't want fancy. It's a database! Make it accessible! I didn't realize there was government app developers.","Very poor app as compared to the older one. The option to filter listings by date is missing. Please let the older app run as well.","The header is so ridiculously and unnecessarily huge and such a waste of space. Also not crazy about the carousel style listings, much preferred the list format, was much easier to browse. The fact that this was released without the ability to log into your account is a HUGE downfall. Definitely do not consider this an improvement over the old app thus far.","Not sure why there's a new app. I used the previous app for years and found no flaws in it for my type of use. It was perfect and easy to use. This one is frustrating how it hides my home and back buttons. Sure the map works but so did the previous app. I'll leave it to you to decide which style you prefer. I know which one I prefer.","Definitely an improvement. New app is sleek and easy to navigate. Still one thing that bugs me though. Not sure why deep linking isn't utilized. For example, when sharing a listing link via WhatsApp, I should be prompted to open the listing in the app if I have it installed instead of being redirected to the realtor website.","Rated best app 1963\ud83d\ude09","Realtor.ca your monopoly is over. Your app is dated, your functionality is limited. I get more, real-time data from other apps","Old UI was easy to use and less number of taps. New UI doesn't look good and need more taps for the same function.

It's an entirely new app and it has lost all of the useful features. You can't sign-in or sync your favorites anymore so each device has different listing saved. Furthermore, each time you send a message through the app you have to re-enter your info (name, email, phone number etc.) because it isn't saved. Disappointed.","Every since they have changed it to the new style it always crashes and finding listings is ridiculous.   Why not stick with the old.  Simple basic! \nI suggest changing it back.  Making things more complicated or fancy isn't always beneficial.","Like many others, I continue to have the problem of crashing. I have deleted and reinstalled the app as recommended. \nI also request that future versions use my location only when I'm using the app.","Useless app. Pathetic to navigate.","Pretty poor upgrade as far as android goes. No way to get my favorites back or sign in. No way to filter the results from $-$$$ or any other way. Screen layout is blocky and overlaps. Sad the old version was outdated for this hack. We should all get paid for beta testing this child's work. I think we are all looking forward to seeing the new icon go grey.

I've re installed it's still bad!","Can't filter results. Way worse than the old app... A step backward by at least a decade.","To the only person who reviewed and gave this a 5 star app (must be the person who created the app).

I'm not sure I'll ever use it.","Super awful. Hard to use. Hard to navigate. Automatically minimizes the home button and navigation bar at the bottom of my screen (no other app I have does that and it's super annoying). I wasn't a huge fan of the old app but somehow this was a downgrade. I feel bad because I'm sure it sucks reading all these reviews if you're someone that worked hard on this app. :(","Nothing to say that hasn't been said in other comments. Major downgrade from previous app that already had shortcomings. Biggest issue for me is inability to login, meaning I've lost access to my favourites. This shouldn't be included in the next major release; it should've been in this one before it went live.","How do you tab or exit from this without sleep/off?","Terrible..what were you thinking? Just keep what had and make it more efficient.","Brutal! Why try to fix something that wasn't broken and replaxe it with something worst? Way too glitchy, when zooming out it no longer groups the listings under less bubbles with a number, the damn list keeps popping up thus blocking the map view...lots of work to be done on this app.","Why do you not have an option to select land with amenities included? A lot of people looking for land on the east coast want to know if there's a well, a septic system, electricity, etc. Add that as a feature when searching land and I'll change my review to 5 stars. For now it's 1 star since your new app fails in comparison to the old one. Cheers.","This new app is so much slower than the old version. It looks and feels like House Sigma... without sharing the sold prices. I'll likely exclusively use Sigma now...","Since the upgrade this has gone downhill.

Smoother and faster.","This app use to be so user friendly. Not any more.","It used to work so well, I'd use it everyday to check what properties were newly listed in my area. Then the app auto-updated and ever since, I can't use it for longer than 3-5 minutes before it suddenly crashes. Twice already I had to uninstall and reinstall it just to get it to open for me. Luckily after uninstalling it the first time, I was wise enough to create an account so my saved properties wouldn't erase if it ever happened again - and it did. But really, something needs to be done about all the errors, and crashing! No longer my go-to program. Sad. I have an iPhone 6 also, it's not my phones fault.","Not very user friendly. Information is very hard to navigate. The map is not interactive. And many other issues.","How can you give this app more than one star? It deserves less than one.  It continuously crashes.

What UX design dropout designed this?!","Horrible app compared to the last one","Wow \ud83d\udc4e","Overall design is clunky and frustrating. Why is the map blue/black? The old app wasn't spectacular and this isn't an improvement. Tons of condos showing up under residential/house. Why did you bury all the filters under drop downs? It's much easier to scroll on a phone. Seriously go look at Hoise Sigma. Shows land size in sq m or sq ft? When looking at land I want to know acreage or hectares. Its very confusing how the mark was missed so badly here. Did you beta test this on the public?","Unfortunately, there is no zero rating. Medieval downgrade, they removed so many useful features and made the app unprofessional and useless!","Plante","A complete downgrade from previous app. Uninstalling.","This is a very poor app experience on Android devices. The app enters full screen mode on launch, which means anyone using a phone with software navigation (most new phones) has to swipe to reveal the system nav.

I've deleted and relaunched this app 4x, but crashing is happening again within minutes of using it, making it unusable again.

Super clunky navigating the map and viewing listings.","Animations are slow, feels chunky, where's my new listings button. How was this approved over the old app?","This used to be a great app. The redesign is terrible, aside from the crashing bug, clearly this release was rushed. The fact that the intro picture is skewed and stretched was indication enough that this was going to be sloppy.

If the goal was to make it so that it was completely frustrating to use congratulations you get five stars.","New app sucks. It's annoying to use and not as simple and quick as last app. I hate when they change things.","Crashes after 10 seconds , IT guys get this fixed before selling season is over ! \ud83d\ude21","Really disappointing","Whoever code this app need to go back to school. Why would scrolling back to the previous picture take me back to main menu? And it doesn't happen all the time but it happen randomly. Map is laggy. Focused too much on the graphics to sacrifice on the performance. No one tested this app before release? Most user these days prefer performance over facy heavy resources graphics.","Whoever created this app should be FIRED. It does nothing but crash.  Doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating it's that bad.","Doesn't sync with the website to show favourites.","Brutal, not intuitive at all. Even having the phone's native navigation buttons at the bottom disappearing is a bad call. The other app wasn't anything to brag about, but this one is unfortunately a true downgrade in UX.","The new UI has a much more modern feel - but it's also slower, and I'll always pick speed over user experience. Can no longer scroll backwards when viewing listing gallery, so now I have to waste time to scroll through tons of photos to see what the backyards look like. Not a deal breaker. However, can also no longer filter by ownership title (i.e, freehold, strata) which renders this app useless to me. Uninstalling until/if this is brought back. Thanks.","I rarely give a review, but I had to in this case. This upgrade forced--by killing support for the previous version which worked great and earned a 4* ranking. Sadly, this new version lacks the usefulness and most of the functionality is hidden away. It appears that this was designed to steer you away from using it and using the Zolo app instead. Zolo has much of the same functionality as the older app for MLS listings.","Zero star if possible. Horrible, I miss the old app! Im uninstalling it's not even worth using at this point. I'm using centris now, oh well.","I wish it was more like viewpoint","Is it just me or is there no way to login to load all the saves I have??","Absolutely horrible redesign. Worse performance. Zero new features and eliminated useful features that were there before. Shame to be called \"new version of software\"... Whoever did it for realtor.ca... you should ask for your development $$$s back....","Doesn't automatically remove unavailable listing. You have to manually delete individual posts. Waste of time and inefficient. It hasn't loaded my favorites for days. Will be deleting.","This program crashes often - it also will only load some listings &amp; never loads the remaining ones. It is a great concept, just a bad running app... Very frustrating.","Boring app","Poor choice to switch to this junk. Update may 2021: I think this might be the worst app on my phone. The layout and function is trash. Deleted.","Very satisfying","This App used to be a fantastic app. Not so much anymore.....took many steps backwards","Good app. New interface takes a bit to get used to, it's a little clunky. 4 stars cause it's full screen for some reason... Make this an option in settings!","Handy app but recent changes messed up the zoom - unzooms a zoomed area for no reason","This app is unintuitive and slow compared to the older version. Nothing here is an upgrade and it's extremely aggravating trying to slowly pick through claustrophobic menus to find the homes you want to. Switch it back or do a huge rework of the app because right now there isn't even a point in wasting my time with it.","Can't access my favourites \ud83d\ude23","I hate it. Why can't I log in across devices to access my favourites?","Poor interface, the older version was far better, they tried to make it more user friendly but it appears they lacked the vision and ended up screwing the overall user experience. User will have to spend more time figuring out how to navigate rather using the app for their use.","Frustrating to find what you want ..ain't broke why change","The navigation of this upgraded app, is just horrible. What a mistake. #yikes","Downgrade from before. Less capabilities.","Editing my review. The app developer(s) have made no effort to produce a usable app. Complete garbage. There are other apps out there for real estate that provide a friendly and functional user experience. Do not download. I am uninstalling this app.","Ugh","You cannot use this app without it crashing on you at least 5 times","Stupid App crushed all the time","Used to really like the app, the most recent redesign made it almost exactly like the US version. I find it tougher to navigate and find properties. Think it was a downgrade from previous version.","I didn't think it could get worse, but here we are.","They wrecked it:(","Can't filter by bed and bath count? What?! Edit: I already tried the developer's suggestion and there's nothing there for bed/baths... Edit: Ah, you have to deselect \"All\" under \"Choose a Property Type\" for \"Rooms\" to appear. Definitely not intuitive, but I do appreciate the developer getting back to me. I think a lot of people are going to have trouble using this updated app. An aside, I wish these were checkboxes, not radio buttons.","The upgrade is garbage.... why upgrade","Wow !! Talk about going backwards! Why would you do this ? Moving on to Zolo","Not user friendly at all, no navigation, very slow, please adjust","I can't believe this offering came from Realtor.ca I expected so much more from this organization. \n\nI hadn't used this app in months. I tried it again to see if things had improved ... Wrong!  They hadn't. It's still the same old terrible app.  It crashes then crashes again. Then crashes once more to really rub it in!  \n\nIf it does work for a minute or two you'll find it slow and difficult to navigate!  If you manage to enter a city or town in the search bar you'll find it ignores what you've typed and just chooses a location somewhere in Manitoba!  \n\nPlease don't waste you time. This is one of the worst apps out there. Don't bother with realtor.ca they obviously don't care about the quality of their products because as long as I can remember this app has always been terrible. \n\nIt really should be taken out of the App Store.","Garbage \"upgrade\". Can't login, hides android buttons (back, home)..... Virtually unusable.","Why force change to new app if it's not ready??? Can't login, can't transfer saved data...","So many bugs in the app. Whoever built it does not know what they are doing","Terrible, no critical filters. How many bedrooms, bathrooms etc are critical filters that need to be there. Monthly maintenance is another filter that should be introduced.","Stupid new layout, I'm all for updating but why do you have to make it harder to use or navigate old app was straight forward and easy to use absolute junk","App is always shutting down. Can't handle the simplest of tasks. Get your developers on the ball and make it work right.","Junk!!","The navigation buttons disappear on phones with software buttons so when you swipe up it registers a input on the screen and then the navigation keys disappear again.","New app really sucks!!","Unable to use. crashing constantly","This new app is awful. I think most other ratings if 1 star have addressed what is awful about it. It really feels like you pushed it out before it was ready.","It contains Virus. Don't download it. It will shut you phone.","This app has been constantly crashing since the recent  revamp.\nAlso, it's been far more difficult to access the map.","It needs a filter by date function...","Awful design, cumbersome and unnecessarily awkward. Aesthetically unappealing. Makes searching for property more difficult than the previous app. As if finding properties to buy in BC wasn't hard enough, now we have to contend with an app that is less a helpful tool and more yet another frustration in this market. Thanks for nothing Realtor.ca!","Just kidding, this app is horrible.","I don't understand why there aren't any filters anymore...price, type ect. Very irritating","Terrible upgrade. Dont get it. Street names hard to read zoom in and the names get smaller. If you have the old one and get this mess you will be sorry. Nothing in it is an improvement","This app is a joke. The design is bad, the functionality is bad. I hate the side scrolling listings. If I wanted this type of experience I would have been using the mobile website (which also sucks). The only update I like is the prices on the map.","Garbage now after changes, not worth the space on phone, deleting today","Hard to use! The map is stuck in dark mode and is unreadable. The android bottom buttons disappear and going back a screen or exiting is excruciatingly difficult. The previous app wad far superior.","Awful app","Not loving the new app. The map doesn't zero in on a specific area, even though I've zoomed into a specific area. The listings appear in a drop box that isn't responsive and I'm finding it takes several swipes to get it to clear. Overall user interface just kinda sucks.","Gggggg","Worked half decently yesterday. Didnt find it very user friendly, but was usable. Today it updated and it's useless garbage. Crashes CONSTANTLY. Waste of space on your device. FIX IT BACK!!!","Great for searching the real estate market. Really shines when you plan an afternoon of open houses.","It is beyond me why this app was \"revamped\": freezing +/- crashing is the norm. Beyond terrible. Have had to re-install every other day. Yes, it is that bad.","Why did you change what worked very well.This new app is unacceptable.","Couple little things left out and not very flashy but very easy and functional.","It works but you have to keep going back to the main screen to refresh the listing especially if you are searching in different areas in the city. Also, all the dimensions in metric. I personally prefer to see the dimensions in imperial format.","The app gives me an error message saying there are no residential properties for sale in my area. I change locations and get the same message.","Doesn't open the ad you click. Zoom feature is glitchy, auto rotates even though my phone has it set to lock, the list goes on. App is way too buggy to be a full replacement yet and should have been introduced as a beta.","It's free, so i've got no complains. A little buggy, but it's just the right app for someone who wants to buy a right home ;)","Low grade pictures, filters don't work and then won't reset, listings not accurate on map. Useless app unfortunately I have to delete. Why are there so many options for US real estate but only this one crummy one for Ontario?","Better then other apps that purported to do what this app does. Its gives all the relevant info you'd expect, loads well on wifi, and fairly well over 3G. I've had the app crash here and there (on iPhone 4) but only happened sporadically. Hoping a future update will add te ability to refine by house type (i.e. townhouse, apartment, semi)","The app had an update a week or two ago and now it no longer works.\nWe were using this app to do some preliminary research on moving west of Nova Scotia and now it is useless.\nVery disappointing and I hope it is fixed soon.","New version is not user-friendly. Missing being able to discern listings that have been posted recently (in past day or two) which the last version permitted. Finding myself avoiding the app and using mls.ca instead.","Difficult to see with the grey background and the black icons.","That's right, I'm not a Realtor &amp; I rated it 5 Star. I buy properties as Investments. I run this app &amp; the CREA app side by side as they both have their pluses.  This app doesn't exhibit any bugs, doesn't crash like the other, is easier to use &amp; it's FREE. I prefer Bing maps as they are slightly more detailed at the Bird's Eye View zoomed in level.  Does it run a little slower, yea, maybe a little. Quality takes time and this app is a home run.  Great Job!!","Meow!  Seriously, helped me become educated with the market I was interested in. Followed listings for a few months. Was confident when the house came up that matched my needs within my budget so I could act quickly. Invaluable. Works well.","The most comprehensive realtor I have ever used. Very accurate information. Very useful.","Not a great \"update\". I personally find the changes that have been made have been done for the sake of keeping someone employed. The changes are in my mind not an improvement. A lot of things are either useless now or visually a downgrade. Really not impressed with the\"new\" version.","Basic but good. Map dots not perfect. It can never do all that MLS does, but I'm finding it very useful.","While not perfect, it's a good first stab at a Canadian real estate app. Looking forward to bug fixes and updates (hopefully) to come.","Maps and locations are slow to show up. \n\nHouse locations are innaccurate. My neighbours house showed up a few block north of where it should be.","Most inept IT team out there This is a negative stars ap I bet they market it to sellers to justify their commission","Moi je trouve ca rapide et pratique. Il manque juste une recherche pour les plex ! Merci !","Can't find anything local. This is worse than the website which is pretty bad.","The app sucks","Went from crashing frequently, to only crashing.","Why why why do you keep putting all measurements in metric?? Now I have to scroll down and open building details just to get house sqft. That should be on top since it is something everyone wants to know...in sqft! Why do I have to tell you the basics? Have you ever bought a house before?","There is no way this latest update Q&amp;A'd properly, if at all. Does not load on several attempts,crashes after multiple attempts and sometimes freezes device.  Stop pushing product to market without proper testing, or fire your current team. Using iPhone 5s.","Extremely disappointed and sad. User experience is worse than the previous app. I used the previous app multiple times per day. It had its flaws, but worked well. The new app is not at all an improvement.","Just tried Realtor. What an unpleasant experience. As just one example not already mentioned here, click on a pin on one street and get a result from another. How do they release something so not ready for prime time! \n\nI've been using Zoocasa for a while. Works a LOT better than this app, and with a far better UI. I can't tell if it's listings are as complete, though. Will test both over time.","The app would be more complete if it could...","Trust me there is competition....with over 40,000 agents in the GTA it's easy to find one. Use your due dilliagence- it's easy. There has and always been an open market for real estate and people have always been doing private transactions if they wish to do so. Consumers do have a choice. How many people do your job that you have to compete with on a daily basis?\nWith that said - yes this app is not the best. The intent is there though","Photo quality seems degraded from previous app, look a bit like photorealistic paintings now &amp; don't zoom smoothly. I do like the price visibility on the map now Haven't investigated much off the app but not impressed, it hurts my eyes.","I love house hunting. This app compliments using the MLS as a main resource. It is very convenient to look up that house with potential when chatting with friends. Latest update now fixes the open house glitch - only glitch I experienced.","Useful","Excellent application. Very useful to have all listings together in one place.","Parfait! :)","Nothing else to say ;--)","Whenever I get use to a app they change it.","It seems to be amazing","Very well done!","It's fun to just see what's out in the market.","So convenient to use!","Facile d'utilisation,encore","Nice app like it thanks crea","lile the mls site in a short version!","Thanks CREA","Previous app easier","Amelioration marqu\u00e9e","This application is mind blasting!!!

Surtout avec les\nNouvelles fonction","And what kind of an app were you expecting from a monopoly?","The old app sucked, so does this one. No surprise really, it's been a problem since the beginning of time for the Realtors. Imagine being in the business of comission sales and having to deal with this mess while trying to earn a living. Awful. As usual.","This is a major step backwards.","The app does what is needed!!\n\nThe only major flaw is the email option does not work!! \n\nA lot of properties are not listed in here but that is due to the discretion of the seller!","The pictures no longer rotate when I turn my iPhone sideways since the new version that came out today. Too bad.","Dont even deserve a single star....worst Dont download","Faire une recherche est devenu tr\u00e8s irritant et difficile depuis la nouvelle mise \u00e0 jour.

They did not show up on this app.\nIts not user friendly\nDon't waste your time with this app.","Zero stars. Since updating this app is garbage. Buggy, slow, way less user friendly and much less visually appealing the old app. Who was the test market for this? Honestly will not use it, switching to using zolo. Way to go","Usability leaves a lot to be desired on Android. The icons at the bottom to go back, or to the home screen of your phone, go completely missing while in this app. So you're basically trapped in the app.","From best app to useless now. Really screwed the map feature","The recent changes have crippled my screen on the map. There is about a 1.5 inch section to pinch zoom the map. Massive regretion","Doesnt even load anymore  I thought updating would fix the crashes I would often get but now with the latest version it doesn't even load. Where is the quality control testing before releasing to Apple store.","A step backwards from what the previous version was.  Whoever has developed this did so without considering the multi-platform experience consistency.","Seems a lot more complicated than it needs to be.","Very comprehensive and well made.","Uninstalled right away, miss the old one. This is garage.","Clunky interface, buried filter functionality, less than optimal map, had trouble exiting the app (ended up rebooting the phone).","Let me know if you need a designer. UI nightmare and I've now had to delete and re-install the app because it got into an infinite loop of crashing.","The screens are all blue, no pictures, trying to buy right now, missing out on listings!","The app is unusable. I click on buttons but nothing happens.","Deleted and re-install. Finally can open the app. Still jumping...not stable but at least no crash so far.","As everything else has already said, the old version of the app was superior. The navigation and zoom on the this is horrendous and it takes forever to load now.","Wrose apps... never expected realtor company have this kind of apps.","Why must software developers \"improve\" usable programs/apps and make them totally useless? \n\nThe latest version of this app is an abomination. To use it I even had to effectively share my google address book with the app owners (presumably for spamming purposes). Fortunately I might have a few business addresses in there, but no individuals who would be offended if they were spammed. \n\nIf you don't already have this app, don't bother downloading it. If you have it, let's just hope that saner heads prevail and force the developer to fix ALL that is wrong with it, and that includes removing the social media login nonsense.  \n\nFortunately I did a back-up to my computer a while back and may have an older version that I can reinstall.\n\nUpgraded version since last review and now it doesn't even run at all. Just splash screen for about 30 seconds and then crashes out back to the home screen. Definitely am going to try and track down older version tonight.","Somehow you managed to make the app worse than your previous app when there are so many examples of better products made by other companies.","Don't waste your time providing feedback. I spent a lot of time providing a detailed response about specific issues related to the app. I also provided contact information if they wanted to discuss it further. I received a canned response saying thank you for your feedback, we will take it into consideration.","Not worth using at all. Weird usability issues, missing some info that otherwise show up fine in the browser. Works much better in the browser.","Worse than the old app. The website shows listings that the app doesn't. Useless. Fire whoever is developing this app.","The app crashes unless you delete it first and then redownload it. Whoever makes this app should be fired. I make apps and they obviously failed to test properly.","It just give a message saying \"You are not connected to the internet\". I've been trying to redownload every few months and issue not resolved. What garbage! Whoever is in charge of this app should be fired.","If there's a word to describe this app, it's \"pathetic\"","The app went from crashing every couple minutes to not even loading. They should have tested it before they released it.","Useless","Pinch to zoom broken. When you finally get zoom right, it zooms in on area when you click a listing. Old app was just fine. Looking for an alternative now, suggest you do too.","This app is a dog's breakfast. It has not been properly beta tested and if the person who developed it claims it was, they need to be replaced by a more experienced app developer. I used the old app all the time. I will be deleting the current app and check back in a few months. From the home buyer side this application was a total fail and from a business prospective the people responsible need to be held accountable.","Bye bye","This app has great potential but there are so many bugs that it renders it unusable. Crashes every few minutes, properties on the map disappear when you zoom in/out, Searching for single family dwellings bring up condos, etc.","This app is an example of situation when project went to people who wasn't able to deliver it.","It's about time crea caught up to the rest of the world.  Data so far looks accurate and easy to use   Although a 24 to 48 hour delay from the agent access","Depuis la nouvelle version lapp ne fonctionne plus.","Sucks","Well done CREA!","This was a long time coming, but glad to see they spent time doing it well.

Much nicer than the crappy website","Haven't had any problems with this ap!","Good app. Gets five stars if you could select title type (freehold, strata etc)","Very handy when out driving and you come across a property.  Will definitely use again and again.  Thanks","Love the option to find places near me. Awesome ap to help find a home!","V1.0 was so bad (map\nJumping around, app crashes) I resorted to making my own app using their data with google maps. But v1.1 is much improved. Works great now - I Like the favourites option. Still not sure why bing maps was chosen but it's very functional now.","Easy to navigate! Always at your finger tips!","100% Garbage","Makes life easierrrr....:-)","Freaking blows!","App is beyond frustrating. Can you please add a filter to filter out leasehold &amp; unknown ownership. Plus a filter to get rid of age restriction properties.","2nd review. gad awful. Once was best CDN real estate app in play store I could not live without. Now I install/uninstalled. Your updates + mucking has ruin it. Shame on you. Went from greatness to worthless.","This app went from bad to worse constantly crashing and seems to have a mind of its own.","The photos don't swipe properly with ther new app (at least they don't on my or my husband's android devices). The pics stop halfway through. If you swipe too soon it continuously takes you out of the listing so you have to start over and swipe through it all again. An excercise in frustration. I miss the old app.","The app crashes the moment you open it. It doesn't list the homes based on the price depending on your settings. Horrible app","It's already been said.....","This app does not provide house post-purchase or selling info.","It's impressive how full of friction points these realtor apps can be. Old one worked fine, just fix the find on map function and voila. Getting error the past few days of \"you are not connected to the internet\" which is not true. After using the app since launch I am still not a fan. It seems it gets worse. Now I can't properly swipe through photos of the listings.. that's a very basic function that doesn't work...","The app is almost useless. Super slow to load and the picture viewing function is glitchy!","Im not sure if anyone else has experienced this, and my phone isn't that old, but the app is completely useless. Everytime i open it and change the listing date, it crashes and kicks me out. What was wrong with the old app? Dont fix something if it aint broke.","There's no filters other than low and high price, and oldest &amp; newest. Would like to filter for #bedrooms, baths, garage, etc. Wastes a lot of times looking at properties not appropriate for our needs.","app picture are glitchy or don't always work properly can be frustrating at times. says im using the newest version so i don't know what's wrong if that got fixed and its hard to find some things like if you are trying to look for an add that you didn't favorite. if this all was fixed i would give it a better rating.","This new app is absolute garbage. All the filters are gone or hidden away, and locked out the old one. So bad, I recommend going over to housesigma instead","New app does not flow, bad font choices, layout a pain to use whats with the blue scale map?","whoever was hired to update this app and whoever decided to release this version need to be fired! the quality of this app is embarrassing.","Deleted the app because it wouldn't open. Reinstalled. Same issue. Deleted again. The previous version wasn't 100% but at least it worked. This latest version isn't user friendly which defeats the purpose of using an app. Its unfortunate.","So slow \ud83d\udc0c","Previous app version was far superior.","You'd think for such a rich industry, they could at least design an app where you could scroll through pictures properly. I've never seen such a terrible app! I'd much rather use the website on my laptop.","Awful","Prefer the old version with scrolling through homes, although the photos are smaller, can scan through a bunch of listings a lot quicker.","Pire pire que l'ancienne app.  \n\nVraiment nul.","This is not as good as the old app. It is not as user friendly, seems to be slow (search results and photos tend to load slower than previous app, at least on my phone), and keep getting the notification that location services not available when app is first opened ... even though location is enabled on my phone and eventually location seems to work within the app. It is so obvious by my experience and other reviews that this \"upgrade\" is actually a considerable downgrade.","it sucks","Very difficult to scroll through pictures now. Not sure why that had to be changed","What the heck is this....","No way to exclude strata (it shows up in residential)","Piece of junk","What is happening with your app?! you can't scroll through pictures properly...it's irresponsive, lagging and borderline unusable. Yikes.","Updated review: some of the old bugs have been fixed, but there are a lot of new bugs. When trying to swipe to view the other listings or listing photos the app glitches and skips over the next item constantly. Almost ready to give up using this app entirely.","What a step backwards! No longer can look for land by lot size?! Too much to list here. Time to look at other apps, I guess! \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","Awful...","Why is this still up on the App Store? Don't waste you time downloading this garbage! It does not work at all anymore? Who wrote this POS?  With the amount of $$$$$ realtors are making now, I'm surprised they'd support this crap.  I can't spend a mil for something I can't find! Just wow\ud83d\ude21","The update killed the app \ud83e\udd2c. Can't find what I'm looking for. It always jumps to the menu's page, without a reason, in the middle of zooming or if I want to ignore the promoted ads.","App keeps reverting to current location - I'm searching for cottage properties...but the app keeps reverting to my home location.....frustrating!","Wow....what kind of update is this?? It very bad, needs fixing ASAP. Very choppy and lags/glitches alot.","App sucks","So frustrating to use, crashes after just a few seconds. The new layout is awkward and not as user-friendly as the previous version. Very disappointed!","I would give it 0 stars if possible.","Way worse than than the first app. Don't they test these things before launch?? Will delete and never look back..","When clicking on app it does not open up as it seems to be frozen on main screen. Vary inconvenient","This app makes my navigation buttons disappear. It's kind of annoying when an app decides to take away your buttons that you set to always be there.","Frustrating and u enjoyable experience. Don't wasted your time and just use any realtors webpage. No price focus function? Spend money to make money boys.","Just stay away from this app. Not even worth being on the app store anymore","Always freezing my phone. Deleting.","Absolutely trash","Informative but would be even better with assessed values and resent sales in the area.","App crashes, and says I have no internet connection on wifi or cellular data","In their continuing effort to make a bad thing worse, this new version is absolute garbage.","This new app is horrible. Really disappointed","Horrible browsing experience. The menus don't react well to taps. The windows for search results don't minimize unless you swipe 11 times. It's looks nice but functionally is atrocious. Its like QA testing was done on 1 phone platform and then they stopped.","You don't sign in to the app so it is not linked to the web site, so you end up with one set of favorites on the web site and one set on the app","The new fix helped with picture scrolling but photos still turn automatically when my phone is laying down, despite the auto rotate function being disabled. It's frustrating.","Exactly what my title stands for!! Piece Of Sh@t!!! Crashes all the time! Then you complain and they respond with kind words and pretend to care and help fix it... But it never gets better. The reviews don't lie \n\nP.O.S.!!!","Deleted this app today. Sent an email to them days ago - but looks like they must be having big problems","Awful user experience.","This used to be a somewhat usable app missing a few features but now the upgrade is totally useless. The map jumps around like crazy and zooms in and out for no reason. With no filters set it returns no results when earlier there were dozens. Didn't anyone test before releasing this?","Map doesn't stay still. Listings only load one out of every 7 or 8. Very buggy and basically useless. Used it 2 years ago when I bought my home and it was great then. I don't know how you could screw something up so simple","This app is a joke. No wonder why people don't like realtors or their useless app.","Garbage app. Original app could've done with an upgrade or two, but this is very user unfriendly. Someone should lose their job over this one. Why does the banner need to fill 20% of my screen? I know what app I'm using! The contrast of colors is gross looking. Having the multiple listings pop up is aggravating. This is the worst. Go full screen on the pictures and when you it only goes half way. Swipe the rest of the way and it goes right to the next. Done here","Useless. Not at all worth loading. Freezing, crashing and did I mention useless?","I didn't even get a chance to install the app, it never went beyond verifying step. Found house sigma app will give that a shot","This was a forced update from a clunky app to a something totally unusable. With all of the real estate fees charged when buying or selling a home, you'd think there would be enough left over to do some beta testing. Shame on you for wasting everyone's time and energy. It is a good thing you run a monopoly. If you are considering updating the app, save yourself some time. Back to using the website...","Why can't I log in anymore???? I was wondering why my favourites on desktop login didn't carry over to the mobile app, then I realized there's no account login on the app, so it only remembers favourites I added using the mobile app. At least there aren't any ads, but I miss the old realtor.ca app","thanks for your reply...but handy features are removed and no new features introduced yet... especially cannot remove the favorites if sold","This is not a improvement not nearly as user friendly as before. I hate that it hides the navigation bar. The worsf updated app I've seen.","Highly recommend testing with actual users before making changes to a workable and successful app. Clunky and hard to use now.","New updated app is hot garbage","Can't login to my realtor.ca account so this app is pointless: there's no way of syncing any saved listings across devices.","Not enough filters","Completely useless app. Seems like the programmer could care less about the subject matter and the actual purpose of the software and how people would want it to work.","Not only is there no filter for square footage, but the square feet of a dwelling no longer appears anywhere on the listings.","This app is still terrible, poorly designed, crashes periodically, difficult to use.\nBut the crash everyone sees after updating can be solved by deleting the app &amp; reinstalling.\nI have seen that same problem on other major apps. I am suspecting that one isn't their fault.","Just keeps doing wierd things","Why doesn't the app open anymore.  I bet real estate agents want it crash so they have more power.","Useless!","Previous app was easier to manage","Beautiful app more options. But unfortunately a little more complicated for elderly who's not good with smart phones","Properties for sale are not updated on time, in fact seriouly behind","This is worse than the previous app!","If I could give this app zero Stars I would.. it doesn't sync with my Google account so I can't show people the houses that I have saved .. just plain garbage why would you release something this awful?!","Doesn't utilize new devices with 2340x1080 screens. Keeps the home bar hidden so I can't use back or home button to exit the app. Even sweeping up from the bottom reveals the home bar but they don't work because this app is overlaid ontop of them. Pressing phone native home key keeps bringing up realtor menu instead.","Not as user friendly as the previous app and harder to navigate.","Poor overall experience. I need to restart my phone to exit the app because the app blocks my home button. Uninstalled. Older version never did this","Won't load my favourites on the app no matter what I try","Way to make a bad app worse. Smooth move","First app I've ever left a review for, why because its that bad. Total junk, save your time and just download house sigma.","Keeps crashing","App was relatively good until last update. Now the swiping is a mess. Swipes backwards from the direction you swipe half the time and skips pictures also; t's all over the place...... hope they fix this soon.","How did you manage for this app to get worse!?","Its laggy and very weird not smooth at all while swiping","The new app was not an improvement, it's clunky, slow and not user friendly. Recently it has started crashing making utterly useless.","Stopped opening at all. Basic QA needed.","They made everything worse, everything.","Your new photo scrolling is now horrible. It used to snap to edges. Now I end up with two half images on my phone all the time. This is getting worse on each update. Fire the intern that you let write the \"fancy\" photo scrolling code. This must be so embarrassing for these developers.","Very bad experience","Yup. Used app all the time. Now won't go beyond loading screen. Considering searching for new app to use","Deleting this app now. The old version was easy to use/filter, visually easy to view properties... so why change it? I have to wonder who at Realtor.ca actually thought this would be better? Or maybe that was the point...to get people to use realtors instead of searching on their own. Maybe that was indeed the reason. Delete. Update to respond: Realtor.ca, this new version is slower than before, not as user friendly, is too cluttered when opening up, not intuitive to use, visually too dark.","The app is fine, it works pretty much the same as the old one, but where is the functionality to sign in to your existing realtor.ca account? When I save a property as a favorite on my phone, there's no way to find it on my laptop other than searching and using the filters. The sign in functionality was what I used most!","Disappointed, to say the least!","First I would like to know if the person or team that redesigned this apps have a drug addiction that interfered with their ability to use common sense. Secondly I would like to know of the people responsible for approving this update are the dumbest people on this planet. Worst update ever!!!! So many functions lost for slightly prettier graphics. Absolutely ridiculous give us the old one back. I'm deleting immediately!","Definitely agree with alot of the other users reviews. Not and improvement hard to navigate, looks like a clutter mess but my biggest complaint is I used the listed since feature all the time but now when using the app I will put listed since todays date and still it will show pretty much all the listing the area things that were listed days ago if I actually want to see what was only listed that day I need to just use the website so I constantly switching between the two. Please address this","Significant downgrade from the previous version. The navigation within the app is not intuitive and I find myself selecting the wrong item frequently. Hiding the android navigation bar at the bottom of the screen makes going back to the previous page more challenging.","The map page is so out of sync with the actual listings is frustrating to use. Why remove the old app? It worked fine.","This has been broken enough for long enough that someone new probably needs to be trying to fix it.\nSo now there is NO functioning real estate app to serve the Canadian Market. Is anyone talking to the Competition Bureau? If Zillow turned up on our doorstep now, the entire market would fall into its' arms (essentially by default). Well done. Zero stars. \nGet this thing working!","Swiping through pictures is really clunky right now. Half pictures, skipping pictures ect. Also, not being able to restart from the beginning without going back through all the photos again sucks. It was fine the way it was with the last iteration on the app. The new priced location tags on the map are great though. This would be a five star app if the photo viewing wasn't so botched.","Waste. Why list is left to right? Do you want me swite left to right 50 time in a list of 100? Improve your UI. Worst overall app. Who the heck designed and passed this kind of UI. Do you guys really want people not to use your app?","The old app at least let you filter by freehold or leasehold...","Fire your app developers and hire a bunch of monkeys and pay them bananas ... It will cost peanuts, you will get a better app and agents can lower their commissions as they don't have to pay any association member fees","Who's the genius who put in the world's worst scrolling feature? Give you some advice as a former owner of a software company. Don't add gimmicky functionality to your application. Users hate that.","Why would anyone put this out there for others to use. A shameful piece of software, buggy crashes impossible to use. Go back to a prior version and send this to abomination straight to hell. A cruel joke for sure.","Terrible. Realtor.ca needs to invest in real developers. This app is worse than the old one. Forced into full screen mode - why?? The UI is clunky and not intuitive. The photo scrolling is not smooth.","This app sucks now","It's a useful app. However scrolling throught photos of properties is extremely annoying. It would be better if an instant transition occured between photos, instead of the scrolling transition (which tends to lag and then jumps two photos ahead)","Most recent update causes issues when swiping through pictures of the listings. Skips a photo, doesn't move far enough, skips next photo. Rinse and repeat. Have been using the app pretty much religiously for the last few months as we look for our next home. Looks like using a computer is the only way to do it without frustration until realtor.ca resolves the matter.","I want a refund, and I didn't even pay anything for it.","Why isn't there any way to sign in to access my favourites???! Hard to use. Not super user friendly.","Absolutely horrible","Search/filtering is broken. The app often says there's no listings available yet using the same filter on the website shows numerous. Recommend using Redfin app or realtor.ca site","The update and redesign is awful, keeps refreshing on map page. When looking at properties keeps giving wrong address. Old app wasn't perfect but at least it worked. Deleting","New app is garbage!","This app has no configurations","This app is much worse that the previous version with respect to bugs.  Many have now been fixed, but many persist.  For example, if you select to view only houses, the only option you can pick beyond that is \"attached\" (there are other choices but \"attached\" is selected regardless of your choice.","Terrible app navigation system, ignoring all the functions Android provide and trying to make a work around almost like trying to push through a triangle block to a rectangular hole.","Very slow","What an absolute garbage app. Map doesn't move properly. Can't zoom properly. Garbage!","How do I exit the app?? It took away my android keys at bottom (galaxy s10), only way to get them back is to find a textbox, click it than the keys appear. Developers please fix this coding bug!","New app very difficult to navigate or get out of. Too sad I used this app often. \ud83d\ude22","Terrible. Has none of the functionality of the old app, no filters, the interface is bad. Basically pointless to have. Use a third party app since they have completely sabotaged this one.","Very poor app. Not at all helpful in navigating the listings.","Filters are annoying Give the ability refresh map on demand, not whenever it moves. Don't show thumbnail previews all the time","My God....this app is horrible. That's it. It's Horrible.","I should not consistently be asked whether or not I want to share my location with the app. Ask it once, then respect my decision.","Was avoiding the upgrade because the reviews were so bad. Its even worse. Will never use realtor again","Really badly designed. Frustrating to use, can't exit easily, filters are useless. Can someone bring zillow to Canada please!","Very poor. Difficult to close","Constant glitches.","Really bad. Map doesn't stay put, app crashes, a Realpain!!!","Perfect!","They made it worse. Its much less intuitive to use. UI is cluttered. Pretty bad.","Such a horrible app!  Deleted and disappointed!!","Goodbye, I discovered housesigma, it's a way better app. Realtor doesn't have sold prices of previous items. Realtor is missing filters.","This app is not usable.","Well, the same as other reviews which make this app a 2 star app, what else to say!","Garbage app..if you favorite something you can't unfav it..even months after the house has sold. It always starts by showing houses thousands of kms from where I live..then you have to spend 5 minutes battling through the broken zoom and navigation to find my area. Every time u open the app..","Useless","It constantly lags. Buttons in app are unresponsive. The filter options need to be improved.","Obsolete version was better. Cannot log into account, cannot sync on multiple devices. Entered over 20 homes from my favourites only to find them all gone when I opened the app again....total junk!!!","User experience sucks.","The app is OK but fails to load images in any reasonable time.","What was wrong with the old design, everything is all wonky and cluttered. The slide instead of this list takes forever to go through homes. What a waste of time and resources.","neighborhood crime maps were the only useful thing this app had going for it","Hate full screen. Please show/allow navigation bar at the bottom. This full screen is very annoying when you want to navigate back and forth","Just a horrible experience all together. Makes me want to delete the app every time I try and use it. It is slow, choppy and glitches. App seems to have been rushed and even more so during latest update. Below average experience during an above average housing market. Someone missed the mark.","What actual garbage. Wow.","Hard to navigate. Not intuitive. Should think about hiring a UI designer and doing some usability testing for releasing the next version.","Can't log in on iPhone at all","The new application is HORRIBLE! Not user friendly in the least. Not sure whybit had to change but they should restore the last version. I wouldn't even give it 1 star but you have to in order to post a review","Way inferior to House Sigma or Redfin","It's a decent app","Wow freezes on startup. You think with all the money you realtors scam outta people you could have a functional app.","There are quite a few hiccups with this app -nav buttons (back, home etc) are gone. Clearly this looks like a iPhone port -pinch to zoom is finicky at best","This new app sucks... No filters and hard to use.","Dead on arrival. Almost unusable. Trying to combine the map with the listings was a quantum mistake. Listing images hardly load, and map pinch and zoom is dead. Hardly any means to contact listing agents directly, a carry over problem from the old app.","The older app that this replaced was way better. At least that one could show you listings that you've previously viewed so you could go back and look at them again. I don't understand why you shut that one down to move to an app with less features.","The previous app was much easier to navigate the map....I continued to use it even after the new app was released. Not user friendly whatsoever....deleted this POS....way to drive away users app developers","Bugs need to be worked out ASAP.","I didn't think it was possible to make worse version of their app but they managed to succeed. Well done MLS!!!","Garbage","y to gttitgzb guy tyg TFT ft by . uth.my hi u","It was a useful app. Then it no longer worked.","Interface is a downgrade to the last app","App doesn't remember preferences even when signed in and if you leave the app for a minute to do something else and then return, you have to enter everything again. Also, it's hard to zoom in and out at times, especially when there are many properties. It takes multiple tries to get where you want to be on the map and it won't remember your preferences next time.","Horrible and not user friendly","How can I filter out places yet to be built? Each day the top 5 in my list are not available until 2025. Its a major usability issue. Edit: 3 to 1 star just brutal I've stopped using the all because its all unbuilt.","Wow, that was a bad experience","I second one of the above opinions in that displaying the prices of houses on the map is a less than ideal method. When you zoom in they become just a big cluster, very difficult to select the listing you're trying to without manipulating the map further. Also, I left the app open on my phone, locked my phone and then upon unlock was unable to exit the app. I had to restart my phone. Please, please overhaul this app. The old app was much more user friendly and not much different aesthetically.","Awesome","I much prefer the old app. This one is hard to use and doesn't offer the functions that I want. Very frustrating because now I have to try and find another app to replace the older realtor app. I feel so out of the loop with local real estate now. Frustrating to say the least.","Older version was way better with layout and finding properties. This version you can't close the app unless you put your phone to a black screen then open your phone, swipe and then close the app. Needs improvement.","The new app is not as easy to use as it was previously. The pictures take longer to load and scroll through. I appreciated the response to my original feedback. Also it deleted my favorites which is a waste of my time. That is the worst of all since it wastes my time. I found it much easier to navigate using the old map function and scrolling down through the area I had selected rather than swiping across like a dating app.","This new app is a convoluted mess at attempting to reinvent the wheel.","The current average rating does not accurately reflect the state the app is currently in. Based on past reviews, it looks like they were having a lot of issues but based on my experience with it as of recent, it's been quite good, no major complaints. Much nicer than viewing the site from a mobile browser.","The new app sucks. Will look for another way to check out properties: Kajiji is a decent alternative.","Terrible UX. Why does it go full screen? I still need the time. Swiping backwards on photos exits the listing 80% of the time. The grab bar to lower the bottom listing pane and expand the map is difficult to grab. Takes atleast 3 attempts to get it down. I do like the price pins.","Such an overbearing login for this app. Why can't you authenticate via biometric like most other good apps out there. I drive by a sign I want to get details ASAP not fussing with login. Once I'm logged in, keep it that way.","Used to be an ok app but now even when it worked it was not easy to use as it was before. Now all it does it freeze up my phone. Very disappointed.","Yup the app is now shiiiiiitttttt. 1) it doesn't save any favorited listing. After browsing for more than an hour I had nothing to look back on, I was even signed in. 2) it glitches and shuts down. Art of the Real-estate scam? Part of covid!? Haha uninstalling","This app went from bad to horrible. The people making decisions about it should start from scratch and take some lessons from other developers.","Crashes on virtually every user action. Did they test this at all before releasing? A total embarrassment.","Very buggy. Untested before released.","No task bar which means hard to switch between apps. This also means no built in back button functionality. At this version has improved filtering capabilities. Overall, doesn't feel intuitive. I'd rather use the realtor.ca site directly.","Which upper level manager came up with and pushed the new design? All these one star review should tell you something. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Back button sucks. The map function is gross visually and functionally. Removed the waterfront selection button. How the properties are shown on the bottom, gives you very little info. New app is a step back not forward. Would rate higher if you still had a selection for waterfront. Make a drop down selector under the narrow your search heading","Been waiting for old app format to be brought back in vain. Finally it's time to delete this app. It's basically useless.","Updating the review after the last update. I've switched to REW.CA completely now and advise anyone who needs to look for a home to do the same. This app is a complete disaster, would be best to scrap it, and support the old app through development of a new approach. This has become a reputational issue for the CREA and needs to be addressed.","Dark screen not enough info.Prompts you to waste agents time on a phone call.Best customer is a well informed one.I won't call an agent cause I don't want him bugging me.This new app isn't for me.","The app has been getting stuck on the splash screen for a week now. Makes it difficult to shop for a house.","App need significant improvement on every level... Disappointing.","I am perfectly capable of zooming the map where I want it to be, re-zooming it for me makes me want to smash my phone. Scrap that terrible idea asap.","Ain't no Zillow...it isn't 1998 anymore","New update is very unstable. Most times it crashes before fully opening and when it finally loads, trying to magnify areas is very jittery and jumps to the left or right, away from the area you are trying to focus on.","The app is way to sensitive to swipe, skipping pictures and listing.","There doesn't seem any way to exit the app.","The new app is terrible. While i would say its visually appealing, its much less intuitive than the previous design and many of the past useful features i can no longer even find.","Map jumps around","Read the title.  Tells all there is to know.  Doesn't even get past startup page.",".Cenitreville N B","Excellent","This new app is painfully difficult to navigate. It is not intuitive at all. The carousel scrolling is clunky and frustrating. Did you even test this with real people?","Smh...","O-1* #not useful","How could you have made this app any worse. It was already horrible and it's gotten even worse.","App will not even open....kinda hard to sell houses that way","Excellent - easy to find listings - easy to locate agents","Useful and intuitive. A very customer friendly App.","Scrolling through photos is so frustrating. Too jumpy.","Cont log in it freezes... Even after reinstalling the app &amp; restarting my phone","Scrolling down quickly is WAY more efficient and natural than scrolling sideways one at a time. Very frustrating and not user friendly","The new app is a major step backwards","I like thes app to find houses by my on","Seems like a kid made this app.......","Choppy,doesn't allow filter options since new update,very awkward navigation experience. Deleted it. Useless app.","The old app provided a section where commercial properties can be viewed. Is this something that can be made available again?","The user interface of this app is slow and cumbersome. It is frustrating to use and lacks proper control. Uninstalled!","Pure Garbage ! Honestly you dev team should be fired or not paid.... actually both.","Realtor, what the heck did you do to the app!? I purchased a home 5 years ago and the app was what guided my decision conclusion. Now, that I'm looking to upgrade, the app is extremely un-user friendly. Preferences are difficult to find, the searching is less relevant, and overall, the app is less appealing. Hoping that upgrades or adjustments are made in the future. Anyone know of a decent realtor app?","UPDATE: No UI improvement to this app in months since original review. Very slow development on app and website. Many of the complaints can be fixed easily. Pros: map with prices Cons: app hides android back and home button bar and need to swipe up to access. Also when swiping up I often hit one of the apps bottom buttons. Very very very irritating.","Not as user friendly","New app is a step backwards.","Dumb devs taking away the ability to filter ....... No clue..","Many things wrong with this app, definitely a step in the wrong direction. Much like what other users are saying, listings don't show, I can't select house type (attached, semi, etc,) and overall buggy interface. Fire the developer and revert back to the previous release.","Takes a long time to load","Five second splash screen...do you really think that I want to stare at your logo for that long?","They should remove this garbage app from the play store. The recent update is truely awful. Most of the time, you have to keep zooming in endlessly to see the price of the house and that's just one issue.","App is broken after last update. Literally nauseating to use now Pictures studder and don't snap to centre or are often delayed after swipe input. I actually feel like I'm going to vomit from motion sickness after using this app for more than a few mins. This needs to be fixed! Fast!","Certainly a marked improvement over their last app, which was a bloated nightmare. Gone is the ridiculous pre-load time and cumbersome interface.

Really wish we could see recently sold price.","The revamped version of this app is awful. The interface is much less intuitive. Searching for properties on the map is more time consuming.  The transitions between screens are slowed down with fade-in/fade-out animations which are frankly a waste of time.

Accuracy of information.  I\u2019ve discovered that many Realtors are inputing inaccurate location data for listed properties, and since this service is the first stop for many buyers \u2014 I believe it would be an improvement to the service if Realtors were more diligent in publishing accurate location data; and, since most Realtors have access to GIS data on properties, it would be EXCELLENT if the Canadian Real Estate Association \u201curged\u201d Realtors to include at least a screenshot of the property extents.  Seriously.\n\n3.  Search options.  The web app allows specification of land \u201csize\u201d (read: \u201carea\u201d) in terms of lower limits, such as 1+, 2+, 5+, 10+, 50+, etc., which I prefer over the device app, which only allows specification in terms of range, such as 0-10, 10-50, 50-100, etc.  Could you not simply duplicate the search-criteria of the web app in the device app, please?  Frustrating.  Also, the ability to specify land \u201csize\u201d if no preference of \u201cproperty type\u201d is specified would be welcome.","- send listings through any app (messenger, imessage, whatsapp, etc)\n- use the app without it crashing so easy \n- u need to upgrade ur servers\n- fix the ui to make it more seamless\n- increase flexibility with choosing lease payments (for ex.

Thank you.","Can\u2019t help think that if there was real competition in this industry the app would be much better. He info is great but user interface is rudimentary but mostly it is glitchy. Small improvement would be to standardize required info (sq footage, floor plans, historical comp sales, etc). Pictures alone as we know are exaggerated.","The app is almost unusable. There isn\u2019t a way to filter for price or number of beds/baths.

I didn\u2019t love the \u201cblue map update\u201d, but I\u2019ve gotten over it and I do love it just as much as ever, now.  However, the units for land size and floor space aren\u2019t what most people are used to when it comes to real estate in Canada.  Land size is more commonly referred to in acres and floor size is typically shown in square feet.

Could be a bit more modern with the share/search functions but overall a solid app","Has greatly improved from a year ago.","It\u2019s ridiculous that an application that is meant to put properties on display is still using an enlarged iphone app on ipads in 2020.\n\nYou are lucky competitors like trulia are not _yet_ north of the border. You\u2019d get killed by them faster than you can spell iPad.","I absolutely love this site! bought both my house from Realtor.ca. I am addicted to seeing what homes in my area go for, been using this for over 10 years and always will!","okay app, I find other real estate apps are better","This app continues to improve year over year In both stability and functionality. I have found it incredibly useful when looking for a home in a certain area with their map view. Very useful app for finding the right house.","It is a guessing game in menu to see what will you choose from filtering options. Unless it\u2019s fixed, 1 star is the only rating this app will get.","I\u2019m watching and waiting for homes in a desirable complex to go for sale. I want to be able to load that address in to the app then be notified the second a home goes up for sale at the address entered.","Not user friendly at all. Very frustrating to navigate and find areas with the dark background. I won\u2019t use this app anymore. Much prefer the House Sigma app now","Should include how much the houses have been SOLD for like realtor.com","Won\u2019t let you find any homes without having your location turned on but more importantly just saw a TV commercial by Realtor.ca saying that your realtor would alert you to garbage dumps, mosquito problem areas, construction zone etc implying ..... that is a lie. Don\u2019t see any such info on multiple listings that are by major regional dumps or airports or etc . \nAnd have reached out to several realtors listed on homes. No response back.","Nice app , but the sharing is ridiculous.","The app feels very janky. It\u2019s sufficient to see most of the data you want, but it\u2019s far too buggy to provide anything more than two stars.\n\nIt never remembers your login session. In other words, you\u2019ll be constantly logging in. It resets its measurement settings all the time.","About as reliable as a pensioners erection, don\u2019t waste your time.","Old app use to have ability to select waterfront....now filter word may or may not work. Would also be nice to see pricing history (isn\u2019t that a new requirement now?)\n\nThey better make changes or will lose out to Zillow","Thanks!","Crashes steady. Map zoom is out of control. Settings way to complex. No stars!!","Should be able to select bungalow","Previous version worked as it should, this one crashes, stalls and makes the photos smaller in landscape view...back to the drawing board.","Please rename this app from REALTOR.ca to CRASHER.ca","Keeps crashing. Not as user friendly","Used to be a great app. New version just crashes instantly. Likely too graphic and feature heavy to be stable. Keep It Simple please. Sigh","I have dozens of properties saved on my Realtor.ca website account login, and the old app had an ability to login so you can sync data between multiple devices, website or apps. \n\nThis new app update does not appear to have the ability to login to your account and sync what is hours worth of work in searching and identifying properties that are of interest. Without the ability to login and sync across devices this renders this app near useless and I need to stick with website, which can be glitchy on mobile devices.","Latest update is a step backwards for search filter options. Keeps shutting down. Disappointing when developers decide to \u201cimprove\u201d apps. No longer user friendly. Have to choose a star to submit but my real rating is 0 stars.","I like the app. It\u2019s easy to use and navigate trough the map. I only wish it had the pricing history for each listing.","Sad that this app still shows multiple listings of the same unit for sale, plenty of pins dropped in the wrong spots. Not supporting iPads is insane.","I use this app all the time and it\u2019s pretty good but has two huge glaring issues. 1) please allow copying a link to a property to clipboard. Then people can paste the link in messages or email or whatever. 2) nobody flips between commercial and residential. If they do, it\u2019s rare. Please have the top button that switches between the two switch between houses, condos, raw land, etc.","No realtor lists fees - if it\u2019s leasehold and what those fees are one is too high of a rating.

Thanks","Lags, apps closes sporadically, slow.","If I could give this app negative stars, I would.  It's horrendous.","Brutal. Unusable!","This is not mobile friendly at all. Not happy","Glitchy. Touch response is off. Sometimes have to touch a photo several times before it reacts to either open or scroll to the next one.","Looks this app was built in 2000.  Very clunky, not a smooth interface.   When reviewing big purchases you would think the app would look more developed.","If I could give this app a zero stars I would because that is how many times it has worked since you changed it.","While this long awaited update looks great the app keeps crashing.\nAND trying to write a review is a royal pain! Keeps redirecting me to other areas.\nWas recently in a city two hours away. Currently trying to look up local properties. Seems the app thinks I am still in that other city! And yes, location services are on and operating well with other apps. \nSO FRUSTRATING!","I hate the new version. I really hope they didn\u2019t waste too much money updating this app, because this new versions ia awful. It\u2019s slow, irritating, there\u2019s leas space to see what you\u2019re trying to look at.., UGHGHGG","Used to be a good app. They changed it and now made it virtually useless. Not flexible. Can\u2019t pull up rentals. Harder now to pull up listings. Etc. Time to find something better!!!","Absolutely awful! I have since deleted it!","Why don\u2019t you guy improve the filter. I am tried by clicking each link, and still get confused if there is a parking space.","Horrible","This app just keeps getting worse with each new update.  I'm trying to run it on my iPhone 6 Plus and it self-adjusts the focus constantly taking me to map locations outside of my target area of interest. The dev team should be fired IMO. Just awful. I'd give it zero stars if I had the option.","For every minute of use at least a crush - fix it or loose users - if I could rated honestly - it would be at minus 10 stars - apps do not come more useless than last updated realtor.ca -\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc4e","Do not like recent changes so I deleted app","Does what I need it to.  Definitely recommend to friends.","The fact that I have to use this terrible app just underscores the monopolistic stranglehold on the real estate market in Canada. I truly hope the government breaks up the real estate cartel.","Total garbage","Unusable even after reinstalling app. Try testing before release.","Trash app","I upgraded the app and it sucks. Prefer the older one.","This app no zooms in for you, is very frustrating, navigating through it is beyond frustrating.","Completely unfunctional. Whoever released this version really should be fired.","Crap","In real estate terms I would call this app 'a handymans dream'. In actual reality I would say 'it's brutal'","New upgrade is useful, but it\u2019s better give us complete information, for example, about price!!! \nHow do we know the price has increased or decreased?","March 2021 update makes the app unusable on iPhone X and iPads. Loads fine but then when you try to use it , the app crashes and closes. Uninstall and reinstall does not correct the problem. Tried on 2 updated iPhones and 2 updated iPads, no success. Previous version worked quite well.","Still awful!!!!!","You can find 10 properties call the agents and they never get back to you! It\u2019s ridiculous","The new changes are awful! Not appealing at all!","Horrible. Can't go a minute without it crashing. Now that they updated it, it can't go 2 seconds. Good job programmers.","Awful renewal of the program!!!","This is a spectacular update in that it's categorically worse than the previous version.\n\n1) Sliding/scrolling of the map is jittery and unresponsive. \n2) The preview panel when you click on a property has a stretched picture. \n3) The landscape full screen pictures are smaller than the portrait mode!\n4) The fonts are needlessly huge so you get to see far less information at any time. \n\nFWIW, these experiences are when using an iPhone 6.\n\nI've been using previous versions of this app 5 to 20 times per week and with just 5 minutes today I know I'll stop using it completely.\n\nAll 3.x versions to date are the same terrible mess.","Doesn't crash or boot you out anymore. Still a little glitchy, and still would prefer the old interface. Usable now at least.","Incredibly annoying. Did the Realtor's Association design this app so people would stop using it?","Constant crashes in last two versions. Even after uninstall and reinstall. Please test the next version better before releasing!","Crashes most times I open it. Feels like it was coded by a amateur programmer. You folks have lots of money...hire someone who know what they're doing and fix this.","Get with the times and make the transaction history available as well.","I don't know what the developers were thinking when upgrading this app from the original??? They took a fully functional and user friendly app and turned it into a buggy, broken, slow, non user friendly app which basically is useless. Realtor.ca needs to rethink their mobile strategy. This must be embarrassing for them as a company. You've just handed your competitors your business.","No more log in option anymore! It use to have it but after the beautiful update , they forgot to put that option! \ud83d\ude1ethat\u2019s a negative!","After the change to this new format this app sucks. Crashes non stop. Its slow, choppy and delayed.","I wonder why these idiots cant fix this faster?put it back to the way it was.. It used to work great...why cant people leave things alone?did they mess it up then go on vacation for three months?","A few issues to iron out, and the most pressing one is the constant crashing when navigating via the map. \n\nAlso, you guys couldn\u2019t figure out how to import our favourites into the new version?  Frustrating.","I was momentarily excited for an update to this app until I realized that all the functions I enjoy are buried three layers deep. The map is impossible to look at, you can no longer clearly see parks and it\u2019s a total nightmare for anyone who is colour blind. Will be officially moving on to House Sigma. Good day.","Their pervious version of the app. was very user friendly and easy to use. It had a pretty standard search method that felt Familiar.  Unfortunately with the new update things seem scattered, hard to use and IMO a downgrade. Needs some fixing","Unreal how crash-y this is. Can't live with it, can't live without it. Every realtor in Canada should be demanding they fix this. IPhone5","It\u2019s in some sort of permanent black and blue night mode, seems to randomly place me in Manitoba when I open it, takes a long time to update, can\u2019t easily set it at waterfront, takes longer to open, gives me some random listing on the opening page when let\u2019s face it, all we want is the map. Omg it\u2019s horrible.","Nothing works as it should, and it is extremely annoying when this stupid app keeps asking to verify I am not a robot. If I verify it once why do you keep asking me to verify after looking at 2listings. Just in case you have not figured it out yet, I\u2019m using a VPN. You want to sell more properties? Then fix this app.","Thanks for fixing nothing","Why not landscape mode, similar to other realty apps? Email for sharing is still in the dark ages too. It\u2019s 2020!,,,","Almost always closes on me.","Awful - keeps crashing \nAlso can\u2019t select of property - detached, town, condo, rental etc.","Quit re-centering the map on manual pan!!!!!  Sometime we just want to browse the map.","Sometimes freezes but norm i guess","This version is a backward step.  No ability to set preferences, map is virtually impossible to see, let alone read.","Pure garbage","Glitchy and poor UI, and never seems to get better over the years. Other options, such as Zolo, are not perfect but superior to this.","Map continually repositions itself. Zooming is problematic narrowing down what you're looking forward is not straight forward and depending on criteria (in suite laundry) not even possible.\n\nThis app worked so well before. Unfortunately, the mobile app and even the web site are problematic.\n\nThe app is technically functional but make sure to have some time, patience, and a desire for frustration.","MLS Realtor App likely intentionally a crappy unstable app as Realtors want to prevent homeowners or investors from buying their own ppties. Translation: planned failure for protectionism purposes. Terrible app.","For the money that realtors make and pay into the system, surely they could come up with something better. Search is pathetic, too much whitespace, awkward navigation","It's better than before, although still very slow at times and freezes occasionally","Non-functional, crashes. When it does run it's difficult to use.  The map preloads some random parameters when you tap 'near me'. The filters are unintuitive.  Images are still small.","Update caused me to loose my favourites and ability to have an account? Wish you could vertically scroll through like before and set a date listed.","Garbage","Was a Broker for over 30 yrs and this app hasn\u2019t improved much since inception. CREA owns and operates this app and is so protective of their data to protect their members. If they had to rely on ad revenue they would surely die. Navigating the app is so old school and extracting any real info to help your search like recent sales or to help pick a neighbourhood is nonexistent. I can Withholding information from the public when they are a monopoly in Canada will not work in the long run. The likes of Zillow or Trulia will eventually make their way to Canada and private direct sales will eventually prevail. It\u2019s too bad they don\u2019t see the Tesla approach and success.","Now they\u2019re telling me they\u2019re in my account at REALTOR.ca. I don\u2019t have an account at REALTOR.ca","All UX gestures are too sensitive.  Keeps clicking or sliding into areas you don\u2019t want to.   This is the only app I\u2019ve ever seen with this problem.","Why are you not updating this","Annoying little app.  Crashes while paging through pics of property on a high memory, newer ipad. Makes you wonder who programs this stuff. No more viewing property at the kitchen table I guess.","Always getting kicked out of the app. Very frustrating!","This app has the market cornered so I continue to use it, but the scrolling is glitchy, as is the zooming in and out on my phone.","Pictures are stuck in a small window and don't fill the screen. Zooming in doesn't help, still framed in a small box","Been trying to use it for three days and it will not load. Woohooo fun times.","They finally got the constant crashing resolved but the map keeps trying to center itself. I just found two house west of where I wanted to look but every time I tried to zoom out or pan east the stupid program tried to be helpful and re-centered back to those two houses. STOP MOVING THE MAP ON ME!!!!!!","The last update works much better! No crashes, very responsive. One suggestion would be: after I move the map please don't try and reposition it/zoom in to just around the viewable homes. I want to get an idea of land space and proximity to other landmarks, but the auto zoom/reposition doesn't allow that and it's unintuitive as to what's happening.","It\u2019s a fantastic app for real estate and probably the number one in Canada.","This needs to be fixed you cant sign in","Don't bother downloading until next release","This app seems to be a simple paste of the mobile app., what\u2019s worse, you can\u2019t give feedback as the feedback form lacks the ability to send! Screen will not flip to landscape mode, if using external keyboard this would be a desirable function","Highly unstable. Great start, but far from perfect. Sloooooow! Check out Zillow for comparison.","100% crap. Dont waste your time or data. They make you rate it 1 star but its 0","Poorly written application. Has been crashing on me for years! Have sent about a 100 reports still no final fix!!!","Brutal, all around brutal. Always crashes and isn't user friendly at all!","You guys must be the cheapest people on the planet.

There\u2019s times that zooming in or out is difficult. Also, it often tells me that I\u2019ve reached my 150 favourite limit, when I only have less than 10 favourited. Frustrating.","This app keeps crashing as soon as you are doing a research. Also crash when applying filters for results. Extremely useless","I found my old iPad and it still had 2.x......wow!!!!!

Current version is TERRIBLE.","The app continually crashes! I have deleted it and installed Zillow. Too bad the previous version was awesome.","This app is being ran on a potato","Why oh why do people who design apps think that all these big changes make something better?? \nThe original app was totally fine. Nope! Throw it up in the air and what we get nobody knows. That\u2019s the logic here.. \n\nThe only thing u guys needed to change was the share option.

It really impacts my house searching at this time.","Is there a rating for -1 star?","Seriously, whoever developed this app should go to night school to become a dental hygienist or something.","Horrible app with lots of bugs. Agree with most reviewers.... The app crashes almost immediately on start up. Hard to understand why the app developers would allow for a release of this version with so many bugs. Clearly no effort put into quality assurance before the release.","Overall I love the idea/function of the app but find it not very useful when I want to look at several listings. After viewing a handful of listings the photos start to disappear or not display and then before long the whole app shuts down unexpectedly. Had enough waiting for update and bug fixes so looking for something else.","I love this app, and I love looking at homes across Canada. A few things need to be addressed: 1: you should be able to share listings in different ways (Facebook/Instagram/messenger). 2: they shouldn\u2019t be able to list houses for $1. It really messes up the algorithm.\n3: if you\u2019ve saved favourites it keeps all of them even if the posting is gone which means it\u2019s hard to find your actual favorites.","Title speaks for itself. I can't even get this thing past the opening screen. Check your bugs before pushing this to users.","The app keeps on kicking me out, also is less user friendly than the older version.","My favourites are gone.\nI can\u2019t log into my account with this new version. \nFire the clown who authorized this, and perhaps the entire team. \nRoll back immediately to the app you had. \nHot real estate market and this is the crap you create...","Needs to be fixed!","Always crashes, can't choose the option detached house, all around a frustrating app.","It used to be ok.

You have no other choice. I would give it zero stars if there was an option","Garbage","Really?","Maybe Canadians should have a more open real estate system like in the US, so that we don't get screwed and limited by the CREA.

This morning I go into the app and it shuts down after a few seconds.","I really enjoy having the up running, and then just tapping on it to get my info quickly.","I feel bad that I gave this app one star, because it doesn't even deserve that one star. It never opens, and it crashes my entire phone where sometimes I need to restart it. I can't believe that realtor can't do better then this.","Deleted and reinstalled and still crashes within seconds. I suspect any positive reviews are from the developers.\n\nRealtors paying to list on this service should ask for refunds as clients can't view their listings. \n\nRealtor.ca formerly mls.ca has always had terrible customer service and even worse technical support. \n\nThey need to fire whoever is developing this horribly buggy software.","3.0.3 is a little faster and a lot more stable now. Thanks for fixing.","The new UI implemented in March 2021 basically broke the app. The map is incredibly difficult to use now.

This version is hard to navigate and just a mess of errors. It always takes me to the map and the \"reloads\" are constant and take forever. Deleting!","The older version used to have the total square footage of the property (not the land area, just the property).  This version of the app does not.  It does have the square footage of the individual rooms but not the total.  Would be great if they provided that info again.","The old app was alright.  Wasn\u2019t too slick but it was easy to use.  This new app has a really poorly designed interface, is sluggish, and confusing to use. What was a quick process to refine a search before now is super complicated.\n\nI\u2019ve reverted to the website and probably will delete the app.  It updated and I wish I had stoped it.  Like the old one better surprisingly. \n\nToo bad, I\u2019m sure they paid a lot to get it developed, but it was not well executed.","I mean come on! Get with the times! Enable sharing via any channel... messenger, text, social, etc. Glad to see I can at least zoom on pictures now. Making progress.","I do not like that the map does stay opened; that it always loads a listing from lowest to highest. Not user friendly.","I just want to look at listings with 3+ bdrms. Can't figure out how to filter number of bdrms. Either there's no way to do that or it's hard to figure out. I swear I'm usually pretty smart so I'm concluding that this app is dumb.","Fire the IT guy!","If I could give this app a lower than 1 star rating, I would. I don\u2019t know what you did to the map, but it is now no longer useable. Hard delete.","Although I can understand the functionality of the portrait viewing mode for people who primarily use smartphones, it is a significant oversight not to include programming to allow viewing in landscape.  Almost every other app does this.  Overall the app is slow (even on a brand new device), outdated and has an unnatural viewing experience.  The website is better but still flawed and outdated.  What do most people want in their experience?   Price, location and nice big clear photos with the ability to easily share the info.  The app does not deliver.","Frustrating.","Downloaded the latest app up date. The app opens and then immediately closes. I then deleted the app and tried to reinstall, same issue. Of course I lost all my saved favourites.","The app is at the epic worst performance. Nothing works. It crashes all the time. It always zoom too close the property even without performing zoom action. Looks like the app developer didn't pay any attention to any of the details. If these guys have worked any reasonable firm, they would have been looking job somewhere else.","Glitch","No more ipad version. What a joke of an app. Filter above $1mill goes in increments of 500K. Why? Anything above 1mill, money matters less? Fix this. If I can afford 1.1 I can afford 1.5? Just like someone who can afford 500K can afford 900K? Idiotic.","The new version is unstable. Don\u2019t bother viewing the map outside your own neighborhood or the app will crash.","This program crashes all the time. They had one stable version and then went and updated and it is back to crashing within seconds of opening the program. It sucks.","When you click on an image.

Avoid it until they fix it to the reviewers satisfaction.","I can\u2019t browse, addresses aren\u2019t visible, won\u2019t show just new listings, too many problems to mention.

It used to be a solid, excellent app, but when It recently had a significant upgrade, it is completely unusable now.","Crashes non stop. Haven't been able to use it for more than 3 mins straight","I\u2019ve lost all my favorites with both listings and realtors. BAD BAD BAD UPDATE.","Hard to say whether the interface is any good or not. From my experience in the blips between crashes, I'd say probably not. Software clearly wasn't tested enough.","Thank you for this aweful new APP\nYou have made me change to other\nsites !","This app glitches like crazy. It's too frustrating to use.","If I could give less than 1 star, I would. This update is useless - it shuts down every time I try to select a listing date. The filters don\u2019t seem to work and it seems to be less functional overall. Stop trying to copy the other real estate apps. And why is the map so dark?","Bring back the old app, and fire the brainiac who thought that this was an improvement - like EVERYONE else has said, zoom issues, won't stay on settings you've made, too much crap on the map w poorly highlighted main streets, zoom issues, oh and the fing zoom issues!","Not sure what improved on this update? Background is hard to look at and response time is much slower (lagging). I do like that the tagged homes have the price visible but it\u2019s not a big deal. Am finding myself spending less time \u2018browsing\u2019 because it\u2019s just an unpleasant experience.","or get inspired by centris","It\u2019s too dark and hard on the eyes. It keeps crashing my iPad. It takes forever to load listings when you scroll around to different neighbourhoods. Not  user-friendly at all.","Trashed it already...","If there was a no star option that's what I would give.","too unstable","Sellers and real estate agents should be rioting in the streets this app is so bad. I'll give MLS the MLS app credit for doing one thing super well consistently: crash. These programmers should be ashamed of themselves.","They\u2019ve updated the app and now you can\u2019t filter or log in.","What a complete disaster this app is. Does no one at CREA actually use/test the app before it is released???  Get it together!!  Shame on the CREA for putting out such a garbage app that constantly crashes with mediocre features when it works, which is very rare!!! Consider hiring a new developer!!!","After the update, constant crashing but a few days later it works. One thing that's worse in recent versions is that you used to be able to view landscape images in landscape mode to see them larger. Now when you do that, the images are actually smaller! It's like it's converting those landscape images into portrait mode first then displaying the portrait mode image in landscape. Makes no sense. \n\nOverall though it's a decent app for browsing all the properties you can no longer afford. It'd be perfect if it recommended a good wine pairing to drown your sorrows with.","The new app seems unstable and not very intuitive","What are they doing to this app\u2026 Some simple features that could\u2019ve been improved and should\u2019ve been improved a long time ago\u2026 Like making it easier to share a listing\u2026 But instead they mess with the UI and screw it up\u2026 It\u2019s horrible on the phone now horrible fire the product owner go back to the old UI... and make the product easier to use simpler less steps less hoops","Would be nice to have the one / two storey feature back.....not same in remarks","What?  i have to turn my iPad sideways to see the listings? Why?  What? I\u2019m typing sideways right now!  \nAnd why not allow listings to be texted. Only emailed thru your awkward system?  That\u2019s so 2010.  And I\u2019m 60 yrs old! \nThe only plus to this app is that there is no alternative. \nI recommend you start from scratch with a true update.","This app crashes every 5-10 seconds....absolute CRAP! The realtor websites and apps have always been terrible but this is a new level of terrible....fix it already would ya?","I\u2019m all for updating stuff, but the drag areas to get to the list are tiny and unresponsive, and scrolling side to side is worse than scrolling up and down. We lost the momentum scrolling of quickly scanning the list to this one-at-a-time, tinder-side-swipe, garbage. Also your thin font in your input fields is way too thin.","This app should be renamed Crashy McCrashface","Won\u2019t stop crashing, downloaded multiple times","They cannot afford app developers... \nRealtor is not a business, it's a monopoly. There is no point to improve customer experience and re-invest the cash. Just collect...","This version keeps crashing when adjusting the listed since date.","I think it is deliberate plot to prevent people from using this database....","The app shows all of North America; it does not zoom in on location.\n\nFavourites never load.","It is simply too frustrating to bother using. Tried... Tried again.. Unloaded and reloaded add, same result. Sucks!","Do not like the new REALTOR.ca, it\u2019s so not user friendly! App keeps kicking me off! \nVery disappointed!","Hire someone who knows what they are doing before releasing another version, and test it.","The more you try to improve this app the worse it gets.","This app is awful it keeps crashing and I have completely lost interest!!","Did the update have to be so drastically different? How do I filter by date? Can I change my map colour settings off this god awful blue? \n\nLiterally my only complaint with the old realtor app was that you could share a loading by text or other apps.\n\nI used to use this app several times a day and now I don\u2019t know if I will use it again.\n\nAwful!","The app itself could be pretty good, if it weren't for the abysmal developer team and complete absence of a quality check. The app closes down as soon as I start using the map on my iPhone 6 Plus. Reinstalling it doesn't help. It's virtually useless as it closes down every single time. Why would any developer release a non-performing app like this at all?","Still really bad!  Keeps crashing!","Previous version was just fine, now it crashes every few seconds....You better get full refund from the genius who downgraded your app.","Please roll back this horrendous redesign. The filtering UI is terrible to use, and generally navigating the application is harder and less intuitive. Simply copying the US app would have been an improvement. If I could give 0 stars I would.","iOS version is absolute trash.","It is a very helpful app, but it would be nice to have a link to the full listing on the realtor's web site.","crash\uff0cunable to use. So sad!","After finally updating this app from the iOS 4 era for the iPhone X, the company has now managed to move backwards, once again reintroducing the iOS 4 look in the latest update. At this point either this app gets kicked off the App Store for non-compliance to design guidelines or it will never change. Did I also mention that it is notoriously unstable?\n\nOh and, we\u2019re now on iPhone 12 and still the same problems and still the same non-compliance to iOS design guidelines. The Realtor.ca mobile website works better than this app.","No matter what I enter it always goes to my home city. If only mls didn't have the market cornered in Canada, I would change apps in a heartbeat.","This app used to be decent. Now it crashes ALOT. It also zooms in on the map when you don't want it to. Pretty much unusable.","Honestly \"frustrating\" doesn't even start to explain how bad this app is! Like figure it out such a great idea but currently just a waste of your time...","With the money they are making on real estate, they should be able to afford to hire a decent development team. Shame!!!","Followed developer instruction to perform a remove and reinstall, still crashes after agreeing to terms and conditions.","Is horrible!\n\nBeyond words a major step back, not user friendly at all.","Have deleted and reinstalled this twice now. It still keeps crashing!!!","This suit is black not (Borat)","Can't last more than 60 seconds without crashing out.","The app constantly closes anytime I try to enter a keyword. Would like to see a feature where \u201cpets allowed\u201d or \u201cpets restricted\u201d is a searchable parameter. Instead I have to click each listing to see if they allow pets?","I badly want this app to work, but I am constantly disappointed...  I will admit that it is working much better with the latest download but my two biggest disappointments are: \n1. Map auto zooming once I pick where I want the map to focus\n2. Can't switch to imperial...  It lets me switch but I get an error right after and it defaults back to metric\nI hope these get fixed!","Ugly, difficult interface has replaced a user friendly tool.","Horrible app","Horrible App now!, had to delete and reload due to crash. \n\nWhen viewing house pictures in landscape mode they don't format properly and become smaller.","This website keeps crashing and not very user friendly.","Please sell commission free :)","Zooming issues, does not keep filter options, and does not have up-to-date listings. Disappointed.","Stop zooming in!!!","Fix the map problems!!!! Downloaded this app 10 minutes ago, deleting it now after it's crashed twice already.

Why bother?!","This redesign of the app is awful. I\u2019ve deleted it","Provides both residential and commercial listings. Very helpful","Please simplify the process of forwarding listings to family or friends and then it gets 5 stars","I hate using the app because when I zoom out and try to see around, it zooms back to where I was... I prefer using the website online.","Given the profits MLS listing make you would figure they would eventually realize how bad the app is and pay a little to fix it. Interface to zoom or move the map is horrible. Stick with checking listing on a computer because the app will frustrate you.","A little better, but still pretty awful. Worked fine before you updated. Hate how it zooms in with no control and many other bad glitches. Wasted time","This is my 1st ever app review... This app sucks THAT much. Atrocious map interaction. You're better to just drive to wherever you're searching. Brutal. Is there a -1 star rating??","Site Sucks if I try and put in a location or type of property it goes blank back to original site yikes make it easier to follow","The map keeps adjusting itself after I've expanded it, crashes regularly, doesn't memorize specifications. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb","The developers of this app should be fired along with whomever hired them in the first place. App, as of latest update, crashes instantaneously. The redesign presupposes one has location services enabled, so it provides lovely error messages when location is turned off. Map does not zoom in/out well nor does it toggle to the list effectively. \n\nPoor job.","Keeps crashing","It's been weeks of crashes, glitches, mismatched listings and seizure-like jumping all over the screen with this app.  How can it still not be fixed? I presume realtor.ca is not run by two 11 year olds in their parents' basement?","App zoomed in and out on his own.\nDid I they test before releasing a garbage?\nDon't bother to download \nAlso if nickname is taken you have to rewrite your review because all what was put on disappeared\nToday June 23, I updated app as well removed  and reinstalled  again, but same issue\nTop on that you all should be kicked out for doing garbage app without testing for a while","App crashes. Can't do multiple criteria selections. Horrible app.\nCentris is way more userfriendly","Fix your app! Totally pointless in downloading this app unless you want your hair to fall our from frustration.","That's all it does now!!!","I\u2019m sure all the new bells and whistles are great for people in the industry but for the average person who wants to quickly find a listing it sucks.   People not in the real estate business want a simple tool to easily see simple details in real time.    The font is way too small with almost no contrast so I have to turn my back light way up which kills my eyes at night.  Trying to find simple listing details is challenging.  This update is focused towards professionals in the industry.  The update missed the mark and is not user friendly.","No ability to filter like before. Just that map of the area. You destroyed this app and forced consumers to use an agent to get their info.  Im switching to Zolo and house sigma now. App is getting deleted.","Used to be my go-to but now it's only if I'm really really bored. Unfortunately the recent upgrade created to many unnecessary changes that make my searches more difficult as well as it shuts off at random.","How can they keep updating the app without fixing the zooming and automatic map\nmovement. It is your number one issue, look at your ratings! \n\nHow can this have not been tested and still the decision is to release the software??","The updated UI breaks everything on the iPhone SE! Can\u2019t even sign in now. Don\u2019t ignore small screen users!","This new update took an already mediocre app and made it worse in nearly every way. How about writing a native iOS app that feels usable and native to the platform? Holy hot garbage.","Plante \u00e0 tout coup depuis la mise \u00e0 jour de fin mai 2016","This has had all useful functionality stripped and is just a lead tool for realtors. Major step backwards.","Nothing better then having to open this app over and over as it crashes like a blind person in a bumper car. The older versions were great. Massive fail now.","Used to be better. The newer features keep crashing the App. I keep removing it and then reinstalling it. Otherwise it was an excellent App!","They removed all useful features from the new version of the app in favor of an overly simplified UI.","App keeps crashing, very very bad!","You have not received enough reviews to display an accurate average of the current app!  HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHA WHAT A JOKE!  You guys know this app is absolute junk!  Now you're trying to hide it?  Hilarious!","Garbage!!!","Never been stable. Been using for almost a year. Too bad stuck with it cause it's the only Canadian real estate app. \nSuper slow when it does work.","This needs to get fixed soon or I'm switching to another app!","What a waste of space on my phone","So frustrating!!!","Not a user friendly app at all.","Not bad","Incredibly slow app and hard to navigate without it crapping out","I can\u2019t believe they went and changed this app. It used to be very user-friendly and I never had an issue with it. Now you cannot maneuver as freely as you used to it\u2019s so stupid now. I will see if I can find a different app because this one is crap and I don\u2019t usually give terrible reviews but this is crap crap crap crap!!!!!","It has served well in searching what\u2019s on the market","This app is frustrating to use. The map zooms in randomly when you scroll around it to locate properties. I've given feedback 3 times and still nothing. I'm sure in not the only one who's provided this feedback.

Interface is incredibly confusing. This is like an alpha test version. I am honestly confused how this upgrade went live when clearly it is not even close to being finished. Good job on taking a useful and necessary app and making it unusable and frustrating. Update has NOT helped. \n\nWhatever team was responsible for this upgrade should be fired and consider a new profession. Horrific effort. Wish I could vote lower than 1 star.","Do they actually do 'beta testing' before releasing?  What a joke!  First time mistake can be happening but very unprofessional.  2nd mistake, no no.  Lay the person / team off and hire new person or team!!!","Says I reached the maximum of 150 favourite listings\u2026.. even though I only have 12","It's like they are trying to make it more and more glitchy.

Now won't even start! Scary if you think this is what we have for a multiple listing service and they can't even release a stable app!\n\nThe only reasonable explanations, as no dev team can be this incompetent (they would have just rolled back old update after crashes), is that they are releasing a program that crashes on purpose to discourage people trying to find listings on their own without an agents. Agents usually print out old school nonsense reports and drive you around to house *they* want you to see, while private buyers who will use the selling agent or no agent will use the app and cruise. Sneaky tactics during the spring and summer season...","I don\u2019t know how you managed to make this app worse, but it\u2019s so bad I\u2019ll be using another one to look for houses from now on.","Keeps crashing.

Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s on my phone or Mac, same thing happens. Really frustrating","Crashes every time I load the app.  Reinstalling makes no difference.

I have tried deleting and reinstalling, but the problem persists.","Took a terrible app and updated it so now it's the absolute worst well done","This updated app is terrible!!! So many bugs and issues","Terrible update, app was usable before, but this is terrible. You'd think with a booming real estate market and increasing commissions, they'd be able to test their app before releasing an update that renders it completely garbage.

It is extremely slow and crashes all the time. So frustrating to use!","Terrible app. Made buy a five year old. Homes don't match maps. You can't filter anything. No thought put into this.","Not much else to say. I would have thought it impossible for an app to be this terrible.","Terrible user experience. No way to filter by ownership / title therefore it shows all these condos in my results that I'm not interested in. The map looks terrible and when viewing listings it's one at a time instead of a tiled layout making it very time consuming to go through each one. There was not much wrong with the old app. Not sure who thought this was a good idea.","The newest style of map (early 2021) is terrible.   The previews take forever to load.","That last update has made this app all but unusable. Terrible.","Terrible It was good at point but this app is terrible not worth even trying or using","Very poor app, specially when you are accessing their website, terrible end user experience with timeouts and captcha errors.","Terrible. The UI is garbage. Not intuitive. It's like someone's little brother did this app to avoid paying someone who knows what they are doing.","Zoom in/out functionality is terrible and frustrating. A basic function shouldn't be such an issue.","Not sure what you were thinking but... you guys successfully managed to completely ruin the app with this update. \n\nThe UI is absolutely TERRIBLE.","Terrible. Keeps crashing I can't even use it anymore. The update is very bad. The first version of this app was the best. I hope you fix this soon.","So disappointed with how terrible this app is! Not intuitive to us. I\u2019m removing it asap.","Cannot see the houses in the list, when I scroll it resets itself. Terrible app!","The app doesn\u2019t provide me a link that I can quickly send a friend or partner. Even if it doesn\u2019t use iOS share square it should let me copy the link and send it in any app I want.","Just use the iOS share sheet, don\u2019t send the email through your server. There are other benefits of using the share sheet (adding my todo list, sending a text message to my wife). The app is a bit buggy, but slightly better experience than the website, with far less functionality.","Who uses an app that forces email anymore? Make sharing easy so I can send a link to people, just the link to the listing on your website would be enough. That\u2019s pretty easy to code, like 20 minutes on YouTube","I\u2019ve been using this app for about 4 years since I first entered the housing market. I\u2019ve completed multiple feedback things and always stressed how ridiculous it is that the only way to share listing is over email. It still infuriates me every time I want to share something and realize the ability is limited to email. Unless I have my laptop handy so I can copy and paste the link, I usually get so frustrated I just close the app and stop browsing.","Great pics, maps and info. Would be great if you could share via text or anything other than email. That needs to be fixed stat. Also the favourites list needs to be updated so that if a listing has been sold, it still doesn't show up as a blank placeholder on your favourites list. That is frustrating and almost invalidates the whole purpose of the favourites list.","The email a listing every time is very annoying unless it will save the emails you use. This needs to be fixed","Seriously, it\u2019s 2020 why can\u2019t I txt a link to the listing?  Email?  2000 called....but your modem was tying up your landline.  \ud83d\ude44","This is really silly. The app (maybe the website also) requires email address to share a property with someone.\n\nI understand the idea behind it as they want to collect into ok who\u2019s sending who what property etc... but it\u2019s really annoying as you do not have everyone\u2019s email address but might have their phone # to share the link with. This is an extremely outdated mindset. Please fix this super-annoying issue. \n\nThanks","Would be 5 star if you could share normally on sms or what\u2019s app, having to type in a email to share is tedious and a really important tool. Everything else is works very well.","While the app is overall clean, easy to use and helpful there are updates that need to be made. Email requirements to send a listing is a sneaky way to harass people in the future. Just have a share option like every other app. Also the app saved me to do a survey, which is fine but NO ONE HAS TIME TO ANSWER 30  QUESTIONS. That annoyed me so I closed the entire app","Cannot send listings with my husband or our agent unless it is sending by email. On top of that, it does not allow auto full for emails, so you have to TYPE out the email every single time. Not at all user friendly; not intuitive.","Still have not send share to Wechat","I have repeatedly written reviews to mention the fact you can not send links, it has to be email to share and the app will not turn with your device BUT I have yet to see changes. IS ANYONE LISTENING TO THESE REVIEWS?????!!!! Checking out listings in landscape view in my iPad would be far easier!!!","Wish you had an iPad version. Also would like to share listing other  then via email.","This app is pretty good but being able to share links to properties through text seems silly. Also trying to change the filter is cumbersome on the App","It is very invasive to have our location shared by DEFAULT when when we send an email to a realtor. There have been times when I forgot to mark off the Share Location feature when sending a message. I absolutely don\u2019t see any reason to share my location with an stranger. I just want ask a question about a property, not to share where I live.  Please turn off default location sharing feature when sending a message to REALTORS.","Ridiculous that you have to email a property to share it. Outdated and not the way most people communicate these days. Please update!","When putting a filter on, and adding keywords, after erasing the keyword app crashes on my iPhone.\n\nAlso sharing a property you should not have to email. We are in 2020, should be updated.","The only app that seems to get worse with every update. No option to share via URL/message/text is such a pain. Many listings I would share with multiple people but I can't be bothered.","There is no reason you should have to email a listing rather than text. \nYour entire app glitches. You can\u2019t see what you\u2019re typing as you type your own name and email to send it to someone else. Can\u2019t see any of the options in the search settings. Fix your glitches!!! It\u2019s been like this for months","Would be a 5* but this application needs to get with the times. Should be easy to share a listing via text by now.","Sucks you have to email the listing to share it instead of sharing by text like you can on kijiji. Other than that great app so far.","This app really needs the option to share a listing other then that I really like it !","Great app! Wish you could send links and listings to people via text message.","Why is the only option to share by email? Should be able to share via text and FB messenger.","App needs text share","Only need is a direct email link.","Horrible. Change it back, just add a share button so I don't have to email people if I want to share a property I like","Essential to home buying in Canada. Frustrating that it doesn\u2019t let you text property links to people - only email. They also should add maps to the listings. Can\u2019t see where a property is if emailed a listing.","It's works, but it's fairly unintuitive. The worst part is the share sheet - update this ASAP. Why do I have to provide you with the person's email I want to share the listing with? Why can't I just forward the link with the iOS share sheet and share it via Messages, Mail, Facebook etc?","Needs to incorporate the ability to share properties by text/iMessage.","Inability to send listing via messages can\u2019t be that difficult of a development. When postings are deleted, zero information is present to indicate which listings were removed.","First, their website is not iPhone friendly. Can\u2019t even use it. Downloaded the app. App works, not bad but have to enter email address of friends to share a link? Don\u2019t think so. Until you fix this, DELETED!","I can\u2019t imagine how it got editor\u2019s pick.\n\nYou can\u2019t share a listing except for email. Link? Social media? Air drop? It\u2019s 2019! Come on. Don\u2019t you want people to share and help promote the listing?\n\nI\u2019ll stop there. The list of badly design UX is too long to go into.","It would be great to have an easier way to share with friends! I don\u2019t know my friends\u2019 emails off the top of my head, make a share button so we can just copy a link and send! Or make a share feature so we can share easily via messenger or text!","The new version of this app. Seems to be mimicking it competitors and it\u2019s terrible. The search options are worse and the layout is messy. \nJust stick with what worked before and add the option to send listings as a text vs email.","Sharing should be allowed to be done through text.   More people rely on messaging the. They do on email.   I find I have to go to the website to share properly.   Also there is info that you can find about a listing from the site that you can\u2019t on the app which is annoying.","I like the mapping function and dots to get. Feel for the area - would be great it you can link directly to google earth.  The app is a little out of date.  Upgrade the share function to a text or messenger vs email (who emails anymore).  The filters should have more options and listed in a drop down formatthats easily accessed from the main page vs. \u201cMore filters\u201d - I would love to see one that says \u201cprivate\u201d so I can filter out houses that don\u2019t have privacy.","The load time on listings pictures is so slow. And why isn\u2019t there the option to share the listing????","Great app except the new update makes it crash when loading new properties.\nAlso, why do we need to share via email? We really should be able to send this through messenger or sms...","Stupid app, stop forcing us to give you our emails when sharing a listing, I don\u2019t want to type an email address and wait for snail mail to arrive - most of the time its getting blocked as spam anyway, but of course they do this to collect emails and activity for each listing.","Like some sort of API or link to share via text, what\u2019s up, email through phone contacts instead of having to type out an email.","It\u2019s a great app. But there should be other options available to share the listing. Not just the email","Overall it\u2019s a great app. It would be amazing if you could share via a link, or message , basically anything but an email... adding open houses to you calendar, it would be great if they included a link back to the home. Finally, you can save up to 150 homes. It would be much better if you could group these into custom categories.","I thought not able to share listing in any form other than email was the top problem in this app but not able to select the price range (blank scrolls)  in the new update takes the cake. I use this app all the time but very unhappy with apps team for not taking any feedback from users.","Should have a text share function. Have to go back to google to be able to copy and share.","Not able to select/see the selection when you try to filter. Also would be nice to share by text.","A first rate app would have an iPad version, and would let me share link without email piggyback. This is a second rate app.","The fact I can only email to share is crazy! Every other app can share thru text, messenger, etc etc.","No easy share method (email?!?), no past sales reports, generally buggy and badly designed, no section for just the frickin square footage... not a good app at all.","Every time you open this app you have to start from scratch, even if you close it for a couple minutes you have to start over and start filtering again. And you can only share listings by email??? Come on, it\u2019s 2019....almost 2020. Garbage!","I love using this app when we are on a road trip, never know what we might discover. I tend to share listings with the same 2 or 3 people, it would be handy to store their email addresses in the app. I have difficulty getting to see listings in another town, it always flips me back to my home town for some reason. Otherwise I love this site and app!","Just copy the realestate.com.au app. It resolves all the short comings of this - better search functions; easier to share properties!","Why do you need my email address if I want to share a property ? That makes me not share it. Realtors do not respond ! I asked for showings, no response. Why then even have it ? Also it just shows how great the developers are by not responding to any complaints. I will buy private without a realtor involved.","The site is solid for searching, however need to bring back mtg. Calculator and eliminate emailing to share! We should be able to send properties through text.","So annoying that every time I want to email a realtor by default the app chooses to share my location. Where\u2019s the privacy for the user? User should be the one who decides if he wants to share their location when contacting the realtor not the app itself!","Forces you to enter email Addresses to\nShare listing with people. Just let us copy a link please.","Great app. Like all apps there are improvements which can be made. The email thing yes fix it and give us a share via facebook, WhatsApp, messenger etc. I do realize you may want to capture emails for distribution or other reasons, but seriously having to fill out all the fields each and every time is a true pain.\nLove the Favourites, helps me quickly go review houses I like, but to remove those which have sold needs just a swipe left feature.\nThank you it is a decent app.","The only listings site I use however it would be convenient to share listings through text message or social media.","Love this App use it all the time. Would be nice if you could share via txt but not the end of the world","The app works well for the most part. Really needs iPad support, though. \n\nBiggest issue is sharing. Why force an email form as the primary method when you can use iOS sharing to allow users how they want to share the listing link?","Nothing to say that every 1* already said. Did they ever tested the app??? The old version is way better. What is the point to used this app without login to share listing/favorite/notes/save search? I dont need a realtor to meet my need. * i dont talk about share feature. My wife and i share the login to view all listing...","I like the app BUT!!! \n1. I should be able to share the link to a listing easily via text.\n2. I should be able to screen out age restricted properties \n3. I should be able to screen out properties that do not allow pets\n4. I should be able to screen out properties that are leases\n5. Every listing should include the strata fees when advertising a strata property. \n\nSo much time wasted looking at properties that are not appropriate because we are unable to properly screen for theses things.\n\nBut number one is the lack of ability to share via text. Yes email is available but text is how everyone communicates these days. \n\nThank you!","Share via email only,. Lol!!","Given it is 2020, I should be able to share links via different channels. For email, I have to type in addresses to share each time. Why doesn\u2019t it allow for copy and paste from address book. Waste of time app. Deleting.","I know the answer. The answer is MLS wants to build a database of users, but it remains an infuriating part of this app. You should be able to text or email share from the app the same way you can from every other app.\n\nIt would be a 4 or 5 if not for this.","I like thus sight, it would be great to be able to sent listings my text and jot just email.","When sharing a listing to my girlfriend a text option would be useful.","I would like to share listings same as others but all in all this is a great app","Junk app that is slow to load properties, not responsive at all.

I would like to be able to\nSend as a text or via messenger.","Why can\u2019t I just copy a link to a listing instead of this forced email? I don\u2019t want to have to spam someone to show them a listing.","Please please please add more share listing options. If I\u2019m looking at listings on a mobile device, I want to be able to text/iMessage/messenger/whatsapp the listing to someone - not email. \nEmailing as the only share option is very 2008 of you ;)","It\u2019s 2019 and I have to email to share a listing? So stupid. I want to send it in a text message.","It\u2019s absolutely outrageous that they force you to share by email through their own app. Most likely a way to grab email addresses. You cannot share via iMessages or anything else. I wish apple made that illegal.","App does not let you share through iMessage. Have to email it","When 99% of people are looking through properties they\u2019d like to share it with their partners, family, etc. Why Realtor.ca makes it so hard to share listings (only by typing in someone\u2019s email) is very strange to me ! Sure there\u2019s some privacy / mls protecting their data rationale but it comes at the expense of a very poor user experience.","Sharing can't be more cumbersome than this. Nevermind adding WhatsApp or other platforms of 21st century, doesn't even let me email to a friend!","Disappointed in sharing options. Can only send by email. It\u2019s like this app has neve been updated since the early 2000s. Can\u2019t text or share on social media.","I\u2019m trying to look at houses to buy. Put in my email and password. Then realized that I needed to set up an account. When I tried to do that I was told that the email already existed. I tapped the forgot password several times. Each time it tells me that a link has been sent to my email. No email has ever come.\ud83d\ude21A waste of time.","That is my only complaint about this almost perfect app. Please allow sharing via SMS! It is annoying that it has to be via email and therefore I end up never sharing the listings!","Why on earth can\u2019t you text a listing to a friend from within the app? It\u2019s insane that this feature hasn\u2019t been added yet. If I see a listing I like, I have to exit the app, search the address in Google, find the listing in my browser and text a link that way. Not user friendly at all.","Can\u2019t share property through text message, this should be fixed","As so many other reviews point out, realtor.ca doesn\u2019t allow you to share properties without inputting emails. This is clearly a way to harvest data, and is unethical. iOS makes it so simple with the default sharing feature every other app uses.","I could only see an option to share by email. It would be great if you could copy the link or share via iMessage, messenger, txt etc","I like the app, but can\u2019t share easily with other people. I\u2019d like to be able to share to Facebook or messages with friends when I find properties they might like. Sending an email isn\u2019t very convenient","The app currently is unusable because all the drop-downs to select price range etc do not load any options, or the options are invisible. It\u2019s been like this for months and reinstalling does not fix.\n\nIt\u2019s also difficult to share listings... why share by email?! Use the built in share sheet in iOS and allow all the regular options to share via Messages, copy link, etc. Very strange choice to spend EXTRA development effort to make the experience worse by using a proprietary email function. \n\nReal estate is being disrupted rapidly and if Realtor.ca doesn\u2019t get their act together, they will find independent entities like Zolo eating their lunch. Get with the times, please.","Handy, like mls and easier to call email about properties","The app was at 3 stars before, but what really kills me -KILLS ME- is the need to send an email to yourself to share a listing with someone else (the canned message is terrible). ONE STAR for that. Just let people share a link to a listing, for the love.","All of the filters are blank when you click on them.  Tried deleting and reinstall and does the same thing. Ridiculous. Also can\u2019t send homes in sms. Only my email. Get with the times people","Would be better if you could share listings more ways than email, would also be great if listings were marked sold or removed. Some sit for a long time would be handy to know","Primitive sharing functionality, can only share listings through an online form that doesn\u2019t access your address book. To make matters worse, your typing text in whit font into a white text box, so you can\u2019t even see what\u2019s entered. The app hasn\u2019t changed in years, time to scrap it and start fresh with modern functionality.","When searching using the map, I would be in the process of scrolling over to desired area, but if I lift my finger, it will immediately go into listing the properties, when really I haven't completed scrolling over to the desired area yet...so it means having to press the map button again to scroll over some more. \n\nBottom line- my searches are repeatedly interrupted by the app crashing.\n\nLatest issue. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I can't remember my password so I click on the link which prompts an email. my email then has another link to verify email address- it ends here because Im brought to a page where Im not sure how I'm supposed to change my password- no appropriate links.\n\nMajor issues. Please fix!","There are a few things that could make it better.  It intermittently seems to lose my search results, forcing me search over again.  It has a feature where I can email a listing to someone.  This is good, but it always capitalizes emails like linda@ so I have to delete it and try again every time I want to email some listing.  What it should do is access my address book so I can just scroll and select someone.\n\nI'd also like to be able to comment on the listings when I email.\n\nI also don't like the default list view of just an address, I'd rather have a headline in larger font and then the address below.  I already know the listing is near where I am.  How near?  Can I set the radius, I don't recall seeing that option.\n\nSo this app is useful if you're looking for a place in a neighbourhood, but it can be improved and made more useful.","Great app but why can\u2019t we share a property via text. Sending through email is brutal!","Can we get with the times and not make the steps involved to share a property so ridiculous? Email? Really? Make it frictionless and allow sharing via SMS, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.. its not new tech.","I like using this app. Makes it easy to see available listings. Only sharing option is email. Need to have more options (copy link, etc)","Considering this is really the go to for real estate listings and the MLS, it leaves a lot to be desired. \n\n1. No support for iPhone X models and the notch\n2. Cant share listings via text\n\nUnfortunate, has a decent layout, could be a great app. But really unfortunate","This app somehow makes sharing listings more inconvenient then just looking within a browser. Works just fine for looking at a listing within the app but most everyone I know needs to share listings quickly and easily ie. Not via email.","The only option to a share listing with an agent or loved one is by forwarding them an email?! It\u2019s 2019 so email is not a first line of communication. Sharing screenshots and having the other person have to manually search is a poor User Experience. \n\nPlease add the simple ability to share listings over standard platforms like text (SMS/iMessage), Twitter or Facebook as the vast majority of other platforms already do. As an iOS developer, this functionally is dead simple to implement and indicates a lack of value being delivered by Realtor imo.","The options for sharing listings is prehistoric.","Great app for looking at houses. one thing to add when sharing, you can only send via email. An update to allow us to send as a message would be better","Love it minus the share with email needed function.","Wish there was a way to remove properties no longer listed from my favourites. I have 100 that state \u201clisting no longer available\u201d but there\u2019s no way to remove. Also wish you could text the listings to friends instead of by email only. What year is it??","The search function is terrible and you are not able to easily share listings with friends especially via text message!","Doesn\u2019t let you scroll down. You can only share via email. These are things that have already been said before. I don\u2019t think anybody reads these comments anyway.","Great app, convenient to quickly pull up local listings by map. Please add ability to share listings via text/iMessage","Pretty sad that a site such as this does not have a txt option to share a listing.","Still can\u2019t share listing over text or over the app itself. It\u2019s like 2002, please enter your email to share this listing....You guys already have everyone email in your database. Let\u2019s step into 2021 and make sharing listings a two click process.","Have to share as email and can\u2019t see all the properties. However this app is how we found our property and are living in our dream home.","Created an account and verified my email - but the app says the email isn\u2019t verified.  Asked to have verification email resent.  Not sent. 5 tries and counting. Can\u2019t see properties without verification.  If I were a realtor, I\u2019d be so mad at you guys!","Should have option to share listing via text or other options other than email.","Can't copy a link or open on browser of share a posting without emailing. Slow.","This app has a lot of great options, but it would be even better if you could share via text on iPhone. The only option I have to share a listing is by email.","Like others have mentioned, it is 2017 and you don't have an option beyond sharing via email?! What about \"copy link\", whatsapp, SMS, FB messenger? \n\nWHAT A JOKE!!","This app is awesome just wish you could share via text messages or iMessage with a link instead of email that would make it a 5 star !","This isn\u2019t my favourite app to use. It doesn\u2019t show the property taxes, so if I want to see what that is for a property I have to email the link to myself and view in a browser, which is also extremely annoying. I wish there was an easier share process that didn\u2019t require sending an email. And if there are videos attached to a listing, those also don\u2019t show in the listing. But I appreciate that I can save my favourite listings and save search parameters. Hopefully this app gets some updates soon.","Why do I have to email a link to someone? Why don\u2019t you allow a copy and paste option for the listing? It would make app 50% better if I could copy and paste a listing and send it through text message. So infuriating.","App updated April 2021, lost all my favourites, the app is now kind of sluggish, and clunky.  I do like how you can directly share to text now rather than email only, but that\u2019s the only improvement.","When I want to share a property with a friend the only option I have is email which is not very user friendly when you want to chat about the property via text. Also when I\u2019m scrolling through the list view the app starts to glitch and it doesn\u2019t let me scroll past more until I basically attack it. Just makes house hunting even more stressful.","Useful app. Not sure why all realtor listings don't show up though. \nIt would be really nice if you can share listings via text or we could at least copy the link. Big frustrating, fail there!","This app is nearly useless compared to mobile site since to share the posting I need to enter someone's email. Just open the share menu like a normal app...","Why can't I share a link with SMS?  Why doesn't the app look up my phone contacts so I don't have to try and correctly remember and spell an email address?  Silly that it doesn't do these two simple things.","One should be able share with a link. Floor area (sqf/m2) is a basic necessity. Locker field seems to be missing. Comparables should be included too.","I\u2019m fed up with realtors listing only enough to force someone to call. \n1) Listings with no rooms sizes is just stupid. I\u2019m not driving 2-3 hours to view a home without knowing room sizes first. I have to know if my furniture will fit!\n2) Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because of liability issues! You\u2019re being lazy. \n3) What happened to listing property taxes?\n4) If I have to email you to get answers damnit, email me back! \n5) I shouldn\u2019t have to give my phone number in order to submit the email. It shouldn\u2019t be a \u201crequired\u201d field!\nIf I email you why can\u2019t you just answer my questions in a reply?\n\nWith the price of homes today realtors are making more money than ever because the commission hasn\u2019t gone down. Why has the customer service gone down?!?","In this day and age, sharing links by email is ridiculous.  Give an sms option or at least a way to copy the link of a listing to be able to share.","Can only see 9 out of 55 properties. Will not load anymore in list view. Also, sometimes I enter search criteria and it displays everything on the map vs what I asked to filter.\n\nIt's 2017..... why can't I share listings via txt?!? Email only is lame.","Can not send links to friends for some reason","Happy with app\nStill can be improved when comes to \"sharing\" at this time available sharing via email only.....\nFeel like no agent needs if you know how to use app and search for properties \nShould be option where possibly to check homes that has been sold","No share button, had to goto safari and type in the address to find information in other realtors website in order to share. Very inconvenient. Other than this, all other functions are 5 stars","If someone shares a listing there is no way to look up its location on a map. Knowing where the property is located is a pretty important piece of information. You should consider including it....","As other reviewers have mentioned, the share sheet options are useless, should be able to airdrop, iMessage, WhatsApp listings to other people, not just email. Also, the larger screened iPhone X came out almost 2 years ago and the developer hasn\u2019t gotten around to optimizing the app for that screen size yet? Come on, that\u2019s just lazy.","Cannot use filters on iPhone, so locating within a price range or type of listing is impossible. Cannot share in any platform other than email. I am looking for a better app.","So ridiculous you have to send an email if you want to share a listing. Still! Should be able to share to messenger and SMS or iMessage just like every other app. Awesome app except for the stupid share function.","Need ability to send listings via text. Also too difficult to change or delete previously saved searches.","Only email for sharing... seriously?\n\nThat's the worst of it. Also you can't view multimedia in landscape for some reason.","Easy to use!\nOnly issue is only allowing email as a share option... I just want a link I can copy and paste into a text message.","The only option to share properties is through email. You should be able to share through air drop/ sms and other apps like whatsapp.  The filters are glitching and you can\u2019t select how many bedrooms you\u2019re looking for.","I see comments from July stating you can\u2019t scroll past the first 9 results of a search. 6 months later and the problem is still not fixed. This shows you don\u2019t care about user experience. \n\nI also agree that a better sharing feature is needed so you can share via SMS.","All properties won\u2019t load, can\u2019t text or message properties, have to email. Extremely frustrating","New interface looks neater and more modern. Search is buggy and map searching is worse. The entire app is slow to load. And you can only share listings by email. No SMS or Messenger.","I like the look and feel of the new version of the app. However, I can\u2019t, for the life of me, figure out how to log in to my realtor.ca account in the new app. \n\nAlso, need to be able to share links to MLS listings via other methods other than email - text messaging and airdrop would be nice, as shopping for property is typically a collaborative activity.","You removed the best feature of the app. Now I will delete this app and use the Realtor Matrix and a calculator app. \n\nAlso you have to email a listing you can\u2019t send by text or copy link. \n\nWas a great app but it\u2019s gone now.","I don\u2019t typically leave reviews but this app is awful compared to the desktop or mobile site. You can\u2019t copy listing links to share with others and there\u2019s so many other features that are missing compared to the desktop or mobile version. It\u2019s also super glitchy. Not worth it","Hate the sharing a listing procedure.","I can only view 9/48 properties... needs to be updated to be able to share via txt and FB.","The app crashes too often. Sometimes getting stuck on the first few listing of a long list. Also only having to share with email is a problem. Nobody cares about this \u201cclose personal relationship\u201d junk. Everyone uses text, don\u2019t complicate it.","This app sucks, it\u2019s sucked for years. It crashes, it lags, it\u2019s not updated regularly. You can\u2019t easily share listings. Garbage.","My only issue is there is no share button. It would be awesome if I could click share and send it in email, post to Facebook or send it a text message. Only thing this app lacks. \nInstead I end up googling the address so I can share it that way. Kind of a drag.","Filters do not work, shows all listings regardless.\nClick on number of properties within an area of the map and will not display listings.\nSearch not reliable/functional.\nCannot share with link.","Can you please fix this problem on sharing listings.\nReally dumb that you have to email people to share a listing. \nJust make it so you can text or message someone. \nIt\u2019s way quicker and easier.\nAlso this app crashes sometimes. I know when it\u2019s about to crash because some of the pictures don\u2019t load up (just white screens) then when I hit the map button, it\u2019s like a grenade went off and the app closes and I have to start over. Super annoying.\nYes, I\u2019ve updated my phone and re-installed the app.\nStill crashes if you\u2019re on it for too long.\nIt\u2019s been doing it for a couple years so far.","No ability to share properties via text or social media.","Good app with few glitches:\n-When you want to see some details on one property, all the pictures needs to be loaded before being able to scroll down on the details.\n-Share functionally needs to be reviewed asap..., what is the purpose of asking the emails of your friends on a phone that is over-connected to almost everything (fb, google, insta, twitter...) if you don\u2019t want to change this function to make it more user friendly (like all other apps), so it might be the time to change the marketing guy in charge.","Always have to accepts terms and conditions. Not sure why, I\u2019m just looking. Should be simple to send a listing to someone - like a link - shouldn\u2019t have to share emails. Step it up.","i hate to have to send an email to show a listing.... the filters never seem to work either.","Don\u2019t like that you can\u2019t send listings easily. And for some reason my account won\u2019t let me send any listings so then I have to search for the one I want to share on the listing, and send it that way. In addition if you save favourites you can\u2019t delete them, and once the listings disappear they stay on as a blank favorite and therefore you can\u2019t add more once you\u2019ve hit the 50 limit.","Cannot see more than 9 listings. Also pls update a way of sharing listings other than email.\n\nAwful glitches...cannot sorting results either, you will lose search results.","New revision sucks so far. Not user friendly.

Now it shuts off by itself after 30 secs and it doesn\u2019t matter what you do, you have to re start it! Piece of bad work! Incompetency is a must here....","They removed the saving of listings. You no longer sign in so have no idea how the favourites work when I use more than one device. Why get rid of a feature? Who works in the IT development. Someone needs a refresher in the SDLC process..","No list view, waterfront search doesn't work, inconvenient layout, no back button. Terrible upgrade, I wish I could go back to the old version. Edit...no, All Waterview filter does not work, shows zero properties even though there are many cottages listed.","works fine except the filter option, cannot see what i am selecting to filter","Used to love this app, but the update is terrible.

Absolutely no reason to remove a functioning feature; probably the most useful and reliable part of the app actually. \n\nThis app really doesn\u2019t work on iPad - they just copied and pasted code from iPhone and it doesn\u2019t even rotate to horizontal.

It doesn't work","Search function doesn't work most of the time. Awful app.","Are you looking for an app that works maybe 1/10 you try to use it in 2+ years? Well realtor.ca has got you covered.

How can this be the official Realtor.ca app? Very unprofessional, crashes all the time. The search options don't work properly!","Seems to work well, except when you use search terms and filters they simply don't work. So you have to waste time with listings that don't suit you.

When it works, u put the filters to narrow the search, yet, it doesn't apply those filters u choose so u r going through properties u r not interested in.

Barely works, crashes, search function is ridiculous to use. Scrap it and start over!","This app is awful, crashing every few minutes. I miss the app for iPad, it was easy to use and worked great, no idea why they took it away. Now the phone app doesn\u2019t even work. I guess Canadians will never know what\u2019s out there for real estate since there\u2019s no place to search.","Pictures won't show for over half the listings viewed on app. Used to work fine - now just frustrating.","This one fixes the bugs from previous version, but unfortunately it does not work when installed on top of the old app. You would have to delete the app altogether and then reinstall it.

In normal customer focused business, the app would not launch, be scaled back or re-built so it actually works before launching. What makes this worse, is Realator.ca continues to keep this app alive in its current form despite the clear indication from users it simply doesn't work.  I hope the CREA will be forced to free up the data for others to make apps that will work.","Buggy, barely works.","Biggest issue is the inconsistency of this app, one day in work one day it does not.

It quite literally does. not. work. at. all. \n\nNo really, it actually doesn't work. I guess on the upside, you've managed to get it to open now. Downside? It crashes without fail, inside of 30 seconds, every time it's opened.\n\nYou may want to consider rolling back to the previous app - you know, the one that actually does work - and then maybe making this one work before launching it to the public? Just a thought.","Filters don't work properly, old app was 8 trillion times better","The newer version of this app is bordering on useless. It doesn\u2019t filter properly, doesn\u2019t show available listings, is difficult to see on the map etc. It is glitchy and works maybe 50% of the time.

It was easier to view listings on map and list, add filters, and navigate. \n\nThe new app has a refreshed UI but that doesn\u2019t outweigh the clunky UX. \n\nHere\u2019s hoping they roll back to the old version.","Old style where what made it popular and better than the other apps, now is just average bottom. Why?","Who came up with the great idea to change the old app??? He should be fire immediately. The old one was much better....

Worst version yet!","The auto zoom and delays are really frustrating. Was much better before these last updates.","Old app is far better","I don't know who was in charge of this update or who thought it was a good idea but the previous version was much better.

This one is slow and glitchy. Don't bother.","The old app was so much better... When i swipe the images, the app just skips some of them...","Brutal. The old app was 10x better","I dislike this form. I liked it much better when you could hover over a map and pick the houses you wanted to look at. This way you have to look at every house in your price range until you find the one house you want to see. The \"search\" and your \"neighborhood\" choices don't work. Not sure who thought this was a better way to view real estate needs to take some courses in marketing","This new version is really hard to use, the old one was better","This app has spiraled into a horrible user experience.

This new site, nobody seems to like.","Terrible layout, not easy to use. Previous format was much better.","Previous app was much better, this new design places the preference on looks rather than functionality and that makes the quality of this app in the negative.

I liked the older version way better.","The previous version of this app was so much easier to navigate, the map was more user friendly and more aesthetically pleasing the dark is just hard to look at! Everything from home specs, to narrowing and saving searches to sorting properties by listing date were so much better and easier before.

Is there any way I could revert to a previous version???","Maps are dark and unreadable! Much prefer the old app!","Still after months of terrible 1 star reviews, nothing has changed for the better.

Apparently not! \n\nI wish there was a way to go back to the much better previous version. I hope they take note of all the overwhelming 1 star reviews and revert asap. This is app has got to be one of the least usable real estate apps I've seen. Looking for good alternative CA apps now... I'll leave it installed for a week to see if they revert. If not, uninstalling.
